# Kubernetes Distributed Calculator

This sample demonstrates a distributed calculator: each operation is powered by a different service written in a different language/framework:

- Go [mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) app for addition
- Python [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/) app for subtraction
- Node [Express](https://expressjs.com/) application for division
- [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/) application for multiplication

The front-end application consists of a server and a client written in [React](https://reactjs.org/). 
Kudos to [ahfarmer](https://github.com/ahfarmer) whose [React calculator](https://github.com/ahfarmer/calculator) 
sample was used for the client.
