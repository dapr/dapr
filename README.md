Dapr is a portable, serverless, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, stateless and stateful microservices that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.

Dapr codifies the *best practices* for building microservice applications into open, independent, building blocks that enable you to build portable applications with the language and framework of your choice. Each building block is independent and you can use one, some, or all of them in your application.

We are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) incubation project.

## Goals

- Enable developers using *any* language or framework to write distributed applications
- Solve the hard problems developers face building microservice applications by providing best practice building blocks
- Be community driven, open and vendor neutral
- Gain new contributors
- Provide consistency and portability through open APIs
- Be platform agnostic across cloud and edge
- Embrace extensibility and provide pluggable components without vendor lock-in
- Enable IoT and edge scenarios by being highly performant and lightweight
- Be incrementally adoptable from existing code, with no runtime dependency

## How it works

Dapr injects a side-car (container or process) to each compute unit. The side-car interacts with event triggers and communicates with the compute unit via standard HTTP or gRPC protocols. This enables Dapr to support all existing and future programming languages without requiring you to import frameworks or libraries.

Dapr offers built-in state management, reliable messaging (at least once delivery), triggers and bindings through standard HTTP verbs or gRPC interfaces. This allows you to write stateless, stateful and actor-like services following the same programming paradigm. You can freely choose consistency model, threading model and message delivery patterns.

Dapr runs natively on Kubernetes, as a self hosted binary on your machine, on an IoT device, or as a container that can be injected into any system, in the cloud or on-premises.

Dapr uses pluggable component state stores and message buses such as Redis as well as gRPC to offer a wide range of communication methods, including direct dapr-to-dapr using gRPC and async Pub-Sub with guaranteed delivery and at-least-once semantics.


## Why Dapr?

Writing high performance, scalable and reliable distributed application is hard. Dapr brings proven patterns and practices to you. It unifies event-driven and actors semantics into a simple, consistent programming model. It supports all programming languages without framework lock-in. You are not exposed to low-level primitives such as threading, concurrency control, partitioning and scaling. Instead, you can write your code by implementing a simple web server using familiar web frameworks of your choice.

Dapr is flexible in threading and state consistency models. You can leverage multi-threading if you choose to, and you can choose among different consistency models. This flexibility enables to implement advanced scenarios without artificial constraints. Dapr is unique because you can transition seamlessly between platforms and underlying implementations without rewriting your code.
