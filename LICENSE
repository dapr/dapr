MICROSOFT PREVIEW LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT “ACTIONS” Private Preview
 
These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
    a)	General. You may install, use and modify the software for internal use and evaluation purposes only.  You may not use the software in a productions environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under another agreement. The software may only be stored on a privately accessible repository and Microsoft may require that you revoke access and usage privileges at any time. 
    b)	Third Party Software. The software may include third party applications that are licensed to you under this agreement or under their own terms. License terms, notices, and acknowledgements, if any, for the third party applications may be accessible online at http://aka.ms/thirdpartynotices or in an accompanying notices file. Even if such applications are governed by other agreements, the disclaimer, limitations on, and exclusions of damages below also apply to the extent allowed by applicable law.
    c)	Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement. Some features of the software may provide access to, or rely on, Microsoft Azure Services. The use of those services (but not the software) are governed by the separate terms and privacy policies associated with your Microsoft Azure subscription. The services may not be available in all regions. For more information see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/.  
2.	CONTRIBUTIONS.
    Microsoft encourages you to contribute modifications you make to the software. In the event that you make a contribution to this software you will be required to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant Microsoft the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com. 
3.	TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE.
  a)	Period. This agreement is effective on your acceptance and terminates on the earlier of (i) 12 months, (ii) 30 days following Microsoft’s public release of the software under an OSI-approved open source license or (iii) upon termination by Microsoft. Microsoft may extend this agreement in its discretion.
  b)	Notice. You may receive periodic reminder notices of this date through the software.
  c)	Access to data. You may not be able to access data used in the software when it stops running.
4.	PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.
    The software is a pre-release version (“Preview”). It may not operate correctly. It may be different from the commercially released version.  Previews may employ lesser or different privacy and security measures than those typically present in Microsoft products and services which are a commercially released version. You should not use previews to process personal data or other data that is subject to legal or regulatory compliance requirements.  Further, for the Azure Services the software provides access to or relies on, the following sections of the “Data Protection Terms” in the Online Services Terms do not apply: Processing of Personal Data; GDPR, Data Security, and HIPAA Business Associate.  
  
5.	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
    The software, including its user interface, features and documentation, is confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its suppliers.
    a)	Use. For five years after installation of the software or its commercial release, whichever is first, you may not disclose confidential information to third parties. You may disclose confidential information only to your employees and consultants who need to know the information. You must have written agreements with them that protect the confidential information at least as much as this agreement.
    b)	Survival. Your duty to protect confidential information survives this agreement.
    c)	Exclusions. You may disclose confidential information in response to a judicial or governmental order. You must first give written notice to Microsoft to allow it to seek a protective order or otherwise protect the information. Confidential information does not include information that:
    i.	becomes publicly known through no wrongful act;
    ii.	you received from a third party who did not breach confidentiality obligations to Microsoft or its suppliers; or
    iii.	you developed independently.
6.	FEEDBACK.
    If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.
7.	DATA COLLECTION.
    The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve Microsoft’s products and services. Your opt-out rights, if any, are described in the product documentation. Some features in the software may enable collection of data from users of your applications that access or use the software. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and maintain a prominent privacy policy that accurately informs users about how you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about Microsoft’s data collection and use in the product documentation and the Microsoft Privacy Statement at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=512132. You agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.
8.	SCOPE OF LICENSE.
    The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):
    a)	remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;
    b)	use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or
    c)	share, publish, distribute, or lend the software, provide the software as a stand-alone hosted solution for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.
9.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.
    You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit http://aka.ms/exporting.
10.	SUPPORT SERVICES.
    Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.
11.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
    This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.
12.	APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.
    If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.
13.	CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.
    This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
    a)	Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
    b)	Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
    c)	Germany and Austria.
    i.	Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
    ii.	Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.
    Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.
14.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
    THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
15.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES.
    IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.
    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.
