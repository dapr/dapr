## End-To-End Tests

> Note: We're actively working on supporting diverse platforms and adding pre/post-submit tests integrated with CI.

### Setup Test environment

* Set up your kubernetes environment and install helm by following [this setup doc](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/getting-started/environment-setup.md#installing-dapr-on-a-kubernetes-cluster).
* Create your DockerHub ID
* Set the environment variables

```bash
export DAPR_REGISTRY=docker.io/your_dockerhub_id
export DAPR_TAG=dev
export DAPR_TEST_REGISTRY=docker.io/your_dockerhub_id
export DARP_TEST_TAG=dev

# set DAPR_TEST_ENV if you use minikube
# export DAPR_TEST_ENV=minikube
```

### Deploy dapr runtime from your local disk

Run the below commands to build and deploy dapr from your local disk

```bash
# Build Linux binaries
make build-linux

# Build Docker image with Linux binaries
make docker-build

# Push docker image to your dockerhub registry
make docker-push

# Deploy Dapr runtime to your cluster
make docker-deploy-k8s
```

### Build and push test apps to docker hub

Build docker images from apps and push the images to test docker hub

```bash
# build e2e apps docker image under apps/
make build-e2e-app-all

# push e2e apps docker image to docker hub
make push-e2e-app-all
```

### Run end-to-end test
