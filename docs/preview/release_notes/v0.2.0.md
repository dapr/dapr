* Actions .NET SDK - v0.3.0-preview01
* API spec
* Samples
* Documentation

### Actions CLI

**Improved** output messages and init progress when installing Actions in Standalone/Kubernetes modes.

**Added** stop command to stop an Actions/App instance pair using the `--app-id` param.

**Fixed** a port collision that prevented a user from running two Actions instances simultaneously in Standalone mode.

### Actions Runtime

**Added** support for granular state management for Actors, conforming with the regular state endpoints for saving multiple key/value pairs for a given Actor ID.

**Added** reminder capabilities for Actors. An actor can now schedule persistent reminders that span across failures or rebalancing of nodes.

**Added** timer capabilities for Actors. An actor can now schedule a non persistent timer to invoke a specified callback method.

**Added** distributed tracing. Actions now integrates with Open Census / Open Telemetry for tracing and telemetry. Users can configure different settings and exporters using a Configuration CRD.

**Changed** Actions Controller to Actions Operator.

**Added** a sidecar injector component using a Kubernetes Mutating Webhook Admission Controller.

**Added** profiling using Go pprof as an HTTP endpoint, allowing users to enable profiling mode and start on-demand CPU/Memory/Allocs profiling sessions either in Kubernetes or Standalone modes.

**Added** The ability to annotate an Actions sidecar for profiling.

**Changed** the way to specify a port from looking at the first port in the first container to an explicit `actions.io/port` annotation.

**Improved** Operator code by simplifying logic and delegating responsibilities to the sidecar injector.

**Added** the ability to pass in custom HTTP headers from the client all the way to an invoked service destination.

### Actions .NET SDK

**Added** the following implementations:
Actor registration,
Actor activation/deactivation,
Method invocation,
Reminder/Timer firing,
Actor state management,
Add routes for activation, deactivation, method, reminder, timer invocation.

### Samples

**Added** a pub-sub sample for both Kubernetes and Standalone modes.

**Added** architecture diagrams to samples, detailing the specific components in use for that particular sample.

### Documentation

**Added** [getting started with actions actor](https://github.com/actionscore/previewkit/blob/master/docs/sdk/dotnet-sdk/get-started-actions-actor.md)  for Actions .NET SDK.

**Added** Distributed Tracing
