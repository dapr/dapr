In this SDK repository, included are the following:

1.	Microsoft “Actions” Private Preview license
2.	README file with instruction on how to setup Actions
3.	Actions CLI binaries
4.	Samples to help you get started with Actions
5.	Documentation

* Actions runtime 0.2.0-alpha [(release notes)](https://github.com/actionscore/actions/docs/release_notes/v0.2.0-alpha.md)
* C# SDK

For the full release notes, go [here](https://github.com/actionscore/actions/docs/sdk/release_notes/v1.0.md). 

## Setup

### Install as standalone

#### Prerequisites

* Download the [release](https://github.com/actionscore/cli/releases) for your OS
* Unpack it
* Move it to your desired location (for Mac/Linux - ```mv actions /usr/local/bin```. For Windows, add the executable to your System PATH.)
* **Temporary**: Run the following command to login to Docker with read-only credentials:

```
Docker login actionscore.azurecr.io --username 390401a7-d7a6-46da-b10f-3ceff7a1cdd5 --password 485b3522-59bb-4152-8938-ca8b90108af6
```

__*Note: For Windows users, run the cmd terminal in administrator mode*__

__*Note: For Linux users, if you run docker cmds with sudo, yuu need to use "sudo actions init*__



#### Install

```
$ actions init
⌛  Making the jump to hyperspace...
✅  Success! Get ready to rumble
```

For getting started with the Actions CLI, go [here](https://github.com/actionscore/cli).


### Install on Kubernetes

#### Prerequisites

1. A Kubernetes cluster [(instructions)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/).
    
    Make sure your Kubernetes cluster is RBAC enabled.
    For AKS cluster ensure that you download the AKS cluster credentials with the following CLI

  ```cli
    az aks get-credentials -n <cluster-name> -g <resource-group>
  ```

2. *Kubectl* has been installed and configured to work with your cluster [(instructions)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

The Actions CLI allows you to setup Actions on your local dev machine or on a Kubernetes cluster, provides debugging support, launches and manages Actions instances.

3. Download the [release](https://github.com/actionscore/cli/releases) for your OS, unpack it and move it to your desired location (for Mac/Linux - ```mv actions /usr/local/bin```. For Windows, add the executable to your System PATH.)

__*Note: For Windows users, run the cmd terminal in administrator mode*__


#### Install

```
$ actions init --kubernetes
⌛  Making the jump to hyperspace...
✅  Success! Get ready to rumble
```

### Verify installation

Once the chart installation is done, verify the Actions operator pods are running in the `actions-system` namespace:
```
kubectl get pods --namespace actions-system
```

### (Optional) Installing Redis as Actions state store on Kubernetes using Helm

By itself, Actions installation does not include a state store. 
For getting a state store up and running on your Kubernetes cluster in a swift manner, we recommend installing Redis with Helm using the following command:
```
helm install stable/redis --rbac.create=true
```
