### gRPC monitoring metrics

Dapr leverages opencensus ocgrpc plugin to generate gRPC server and client metrics.

* [server metrics](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-go/blob/master/plugin/ocgrpc/server_metrics.go)
* [client_metrics](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-go/blob/master/plugin/ocgrpc/client_metrics.go)

#### gRPC Server metrics

* dapr_grpc_io_server_received_bytes_per_rpc_*: Distribution of received bytes per RPC, by method.
* dapr_grpc_io_server_sent_bytes_per_rpc_*: Distribution of total sent bytes per RPC, by method.
* dapr_grpc_io_server_server_latency_*: Distribution of server latency in milliseconds, by method.
* dapr_grpc_io_server_completed_rpcs: Count of RPCs by method and status.

#### gRPC Client metrics

* dapr_grpc_io_client_sent_bytes_per_rpc: Distribution of bytes sent per RPC, by method.
* dapr_grpc_io_client_received_bytes_per_rpc_*: Distribution of bytes received per RPC, by method.
