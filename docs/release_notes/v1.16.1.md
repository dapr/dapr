- [Sidecar Injector Crash with Disabled Scheduler](#sidecar-injector-crash-with-disabled-scheduler)

## Sidecar Injector Crash with Disabled Scheduler

### Problem
The sidecar injector crashes with error (`dapr-scheduler-server StatefulSet not found`) when the scheduler is disabled via Helm chart (`global.scheduler.enabled: false`).

### Impact
The crash prevents the sidecar injector from functioning correctly when the scheduler is disabled, disrupting deployments.

### Root cause
A previous change caused the `dapr-scheduler-server` StatefulSet to be removed when the scheduler was disabled, instead of scaling it to 0 as originally intended. The injector, hardcoded to check for the StatefulSet in the `injector.go` file, fails when it is not found.

### Solution
Revert the behavior to scale the `dapr-scheduler-server` StatefulSet to 0 when the scheduler is disabled, instead of removing it, as implemented in the Helm chart.
