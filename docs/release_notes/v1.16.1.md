- [Workflow actors reminders stopped after Application Health check transition](#workflow-actors-reminders-stopped-after-application-health-check-transition)
- [Fix Scheduler Etcd client port networking in standalone mode](#fix-scheduler-etcd-client-port-networking-in-standalone-mode)

## Sidecar Injector Crash with Disabled Scheduler

### Problem
The sidecar injector crashes with error (`dapr-scheduler-server StatefulSet not found`) when the scheduler is disabled via Helm chart (`global.scheduler.enabled: false`).

### Impact
The crash prevents the sidecar injector from functioning correctly when the scheduler is disabled, disrupting deployments.

### Root cause
A previous change caused the `dapr-scheduler-server` StatefulSet to be removed when the scheduler was disabled, instead of scaling it to 0 as originally intended. The injector, hardcoded to check for the StatefulSet in the `injector.go` file, fails when it is not found.

### Solution
Revert the behavior to scale the `dapr-scheduler-server` StatefulSet to 0 when the scheduler is disabled, instead of removing it, as implemented in the Helm chart.


## Workflow actors reminders stopped after Application Health check transition

### Problem
Application Health checks transitioning from unhealthy to healthy were incorrectly configuring the scheduler clients to stop watching for actor reminder jobs.

### Impact
The misconfiguration in the scheduler clients made workflows to stop executing because reminders no longer executed.

### Root cause
On Application Health change daprd was able to trigger an actors update for an empty slice, which caused a scheduler client reconfiguration. However because there were no changes in the actor types, daprd never received a new version of the placement table which caused the scheduler clients to get misconfigured. This happens because when daprd sends an actor types update to the placement server daprd wipes out the known actor types in the scheduler client, and because daprd never received an acknowledgement from placement with a new table version then the scheduler client never got updated back with the actor types.

### Solution
Prevent any changes to hosted actor types if the input slice is empty

## Fix Scheduler Etcd client port networking in standalone mode

### Problem

The Scheduler Etcd client port is not available when running in Dapr CLI standalone mode.

### Impact

Cannot perform Scheduler Etcd admin operations in Dapr CLI standalone mode.

### Root cause

The Scheduler Etcd client port is only listened on localhost.

### Solution

The Scheduler Etcd client listen address is now configurable via the `--scheduler-etcd-client-listen-address` CLI flag, meaning port can be exposed when running in standalone mode.
