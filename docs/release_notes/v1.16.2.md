# Dapr 1.16.2

This update includes bug fixes:

- [HTTP API default CORS behavior](#http-api-default-cors-behavior)

## HTTP API default CORS behavior

### Problem
In the 1.16.0 release a change was introduced that changed the default behavior of CORS in the Dapr HTTP API. Now by default CORS headers were added to all HTTP responses. However this new behavior couldn't be disabled.

### Impact
This caused problems in scenarios where CORS is handled outside of the Dapr sidecar, because the Dapr Sidecar always added CORS headers.

### Solution
Revert part of the behavior introduced in this [PR](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/9025) and change the default value of `allowed-origins` flag to be an empty string, and disabling the CORS filter by default.
