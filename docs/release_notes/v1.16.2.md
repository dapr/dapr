# Dapr 1.16.2

This update includes bug fixes:

- [HTTP API default CORS behavior](#http-api-default-cors-behavior)
- [Scheduler External etcd with multiple client endpoints](#scheduler-external-etcd-with-multiple-client-endpoints)

## HTTP API default CORS behavior

### Problem
In the 1.16.0 release a change was introduced that changed the default behavior of CORS in the Dapr HTTP API. Now by default CORS headers were added to all HTTP responses. However this new behavior couldn't be disabled.

### Impact
This caused problems in scenarios where CORS is handled outside of the Dapr sidecar, because the Dapr Sidecar always added CORS headers.

### Solution
Revert part of the behavior introduced in this [PR](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/9025) and change the default value of `allowed-origins` flag to be an empty string, and disabling the CORS filter by default.

## Scheduler External etcd with multiple client endpoints

### Problem

Using Scheduler in non-embed mode with multiple etcd client endpoints was not working.

### Impact

It was not possible to use multiple etcd endpoints for high availability with an external etcd database for scheduler.

### Root Cause

The Scheduler etcd client endpoints CLI flag was typed as an string array, rather than a string slice, causing the given value to be parsed as a single string rather than a slice of strings.

### Solution

Changed the type of the etcd client endpoints CLI flag to be a string slice.
