# Dapr 1.14.1

## Fix Dapr Workflow

### Problem

When reusing instance ID in Dapr Workflow, the reminder that deletes in-flight activities would not be called, leaving the workflow in running state.

### Impact

Dapr Workflow not processing delete reminder correctly.

### Root cause

Change to adopt scheduler in workflows affected the default code path too.

### Solution

Flag to only apply the scheduler settings when user opts-in for scheduler reminders.
