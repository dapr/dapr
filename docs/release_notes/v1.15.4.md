- [Allow Service Account for MetalBear mirrord operator in sidecar injector](#allow-service-account-for-metalbear-mirrord-operator-in-sidecar-injector)

## Fix degradation of Workflow runtime performance over time

### Problem

Running a Workflow app multiple times would cause the performance of the Workflow runtime to degrade significantly over multiple runs.

### Impact

Workflow applications would not complete in a timely manner.

### Root cause

There was an issue whereby Scheduler client (daprd) connections where not properly pruned from the connection pool for a given Namespace's appID/actorTypes set.
This would lead to jobs/actor reminders being sent to stale client connections that were no longer active.
This caused Jobs to fail, and enter failure policy retry loops.

### Solution

Refactor the Scheduler connection pool logic to properly prune stale connections to prevent job execution occurring on stale connections and causing failure policy loops.

## Allow Service Account for MetalBear mirrord operator in sidecar injector

### Problem

Mirrord Operator is not on the allow list of Service Accounts for the dapr sidecar injector.

### Impact

Running mirrord in `copy_target` mode would cause the pod to initalise with without the dapr container.

### Root cause

Mirrord Operator is not on the allow list of Service Accounts for the dapr sidecar injector.

### Solution

Add the Mirrord Operator into the allow list of Service Accounts for the dapr sidecar injector.
