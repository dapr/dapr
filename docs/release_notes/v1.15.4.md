## Fix degradation of Workflow runtime performance over time

### Problem

Running a Workflow app multiple times would cause the performance of the Workflow runtime to degrade significantly over multiple runs.

### Impact

Workflow applications would not complete in a timely manner.

### Root cause

There was an issue whereby Scheduler client (daprd) connections where not properly pruned from the connection pool for a given Namespace's appID/actorTypes set.
This would lead to jobs/actor reminders being sent to stale client connections that were no longer active.
This caused Jobs to fail, and enter failure policy retry loops.

### Solution

Refactor the Scheduler connection pool logic to properly prune stale connections to prevent job execution occurring on stale connections and causing failure policy loops.

## Fix remote Actor invocation 500 retry

### Problem

An actor invocation across hosts which result in a 500 HTTP header response code would result in the request being retried 5 times.

### Impact

Services which return a 500 HTTP header response code would result in requests under normal operation to return slowly, and request the service on the same request multiple times.

### Root cause

The Actor engine considered a 500 HTTP header response code to be a retriable error, rather than a successful request which returned a non-200 status code.

### Solution

Remove the 500 HTTP header response code from the list of retriable errors.

### Problem

## Fix Global Actors Enabled Configuration

### Problem

When `global.actors.enabled` was set to `false` via Helm or the environment variable `ACTORS_ENABLED=false`, the Dapr sidecar would still attempt to connect to the placement service, causing readiness probe failures and repeatedly logged errors about failing to connect to placement.
Fixes this [issue](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/8551).

### Impact

Dapr sidecars would fail their readiness probes and log errors like:
```
Failed to connect to placement dns:///dapr-placement-server.dapr-system.svc.cluster.local:50005: failed to create placement client: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = last resolver error: produced zero addresses
```

### Root cause

The sidecar injector was not properly respecting the global actors enabled configuration when setting up the placement service connection.

### Solution

The sidecar injector now properly respects the `global.actors.enabled` helm configuration and `ACTORS_ENABLED` environment variable. When set to `false`, it will not attempt to connect to the placement service, allowing the sidecar to start successfully without actor functionality.


## Prevent panic of reminder operations on slow Actor Startup

### Problem

The Dapr runtime HTTP server would panic if a reminder operation timed out while an Actor was starting up.

### Impact

The HTTP server would panic, causing degraded performance.

### Root cause

The Dapr runtime would attempt to use the reminder service before it was initialized.

### Solution

Correctly return an errors that the actor runtime was not ready in time for the reminder operation.
