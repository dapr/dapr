# Dapr 0.11.1

## Fixes

* Fixed Dapr sidecar authentication issue when Highly available mode is enabled (https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2187)

### Overview
[The issue](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2187) fixed in the 0.11.1 release contained a regression that caused the Dapr control plane services to not function when running in HA (High Availability) mode enabled.

The root cause was that multiple instances (3 in the case of HA mode) of the Sentry Certificate Authority would race to create new root certs.
Until the pods were restarted to load the certificate from the secret store, each instance would contain different root CAs and would issue different certificates to the Dapr control plane pods and the Dapr sidecars, which resulted in rejected connections.

The issue was fixed with [this PR](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/2185).

In addition, an [issue was opened](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2188) to make sure that e2e tests run in HA mode in addition to a single pod setup.
The issue was closed with the merging of this [PR](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/2189).
