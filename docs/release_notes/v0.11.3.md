## Fixes

* Improve actor service health check relibility to avoid unexpected placement disconnection(https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/2292).
* Do not track Actor ID for actor pending lock count metric(https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/2295)

### Overview

We have run load test for actor to evaluate the performance and relibility with the load test since the last milestone. The test discovered [the below issues](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2093) causing memory leak:

1. Frequent reconnections to placement service when app http endpoint is unresponsive intermitently under high load scneario
2. Memory increases from http middleware when recording request metric
3. Unnecessary memory allocation in actor invocation flow

The original plan was to release all fixes in 1.0 RC1, but we decided to release this hotfix addressing the first and second issues because these fixes reduce memory usage and improve the reliability of placement.

For 1.0 RC1 release, we will enable Raft in placement to enable leader election for highly availability mode and fix the rest of memory leak issues.
