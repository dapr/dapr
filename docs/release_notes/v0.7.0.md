## Upgrading to Dapr 0.7.0

If you're upgrading from an older version of Dapr to 0.7.0, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade. You know, the one where you don't get red errors on the terminal.. we all hate that, right?

### Local Machine / Self-hosted

Uninstall Dapr using the CLI you currently have:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

Next, get the latest CLI following [these](https://github.com/dapr/cli#installing-dapr-cli) instructions, or alternatively download the latest and greatest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

Once you have downloaded the CLI, run:

```bash
dapr init
```

Wait for the update to finish, and you're good to go!
Make sure you have the right runtime version (0.7.0) with:

```bash
dapr --version
```

### Kubernetes

Download the latest CLI release as outlined above in the `Local Machine / Self-hosted` section.

If you previously installed Dapr on your Kubernetes cluster using the Dapr CLI, run:

```bash
dapr uninstall --kubernetes
```

It's fine to ignore any errors that might show up.

If you previously installed Dapr using __Helm 2.X__:

```bash
helm del --purge dapr
```

If you previously installed Dapr using __Helm 3.X__:

```bash
helm uninstall dapr -n dapr-system
```

```bash
helm repo update
```

Wait until Dapr is uninstalled, and make sure the `dapr-system` namespace is gone.

If you installed Dapr with Helm to a namespace other than `dapr-system`, modify the uninstall command above to account for that.

You can now follow [these](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/getting-started/environment-setup.md#using-helm-advanced) instructions on how to install Dapr using __Helm 3__.

Alternatively, if you want to install Dapr in a dev/test setup, run:

```
dapr init --kubernetes
```

#### Post installation

After Dapr 0.7.0 has been installed, perform a rolling restart for your deployments.
