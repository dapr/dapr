# Dapr 1.15.3

This update includes bug fixes:

- [Fix Timers Deactivating after timer invocation fails](#fix-timers-deactivating-after-timer-invocation-fails)
- [Fix Daprd continuously growing in memory](#fix-daprd-continuously-growing-in-memory)
- [Fix Scheduler continuously growing in memory](#fix-scheduler-continuously-growing-in-memory)

## Fix Timers Deactivating after timer invocation fails

### Problem

Fixes this [issue](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/8548).
An app returning a non-2xx status code from a timer invocation would cause a periodic timer to no longer trigger.

### Impact

An Actor app which restarted/crashed, or was otherwise busy, would cause a timer to no longer trigger.
This breaks backwards compatibility where a periodic Actor timer would continue to trigger at the defined period, even if the actor was busy or had an error.

### Root cause

The Actor timer handle logic deactivates the timer if _any_ timer invocation failed.
Regardless of whether the timer had further ticks defined in it's period schedule.

### Solution

As did before v1.15.0, treat any successful or failed timer invocation as the same, and tick the Actor timer forward allowing for future invocations.

## Fix Daprd continuously growing in memory

### Problem

Fixes an issue where Daprd would continually grow in memory when using Workflows.

### Impact

Daprd would eventually use all available memory on the node or cgroup, causing an OOM crash.

### Root cause

An internal Actor lock object was not being released from Workflow Activities.

### Solution

Release lock memory during Workflow Activity completion.

## Fix Scheduler continuously growing in memory

### Problem

Scheduler would continuously grow in memory when under heavy usage, for example using Workflows.

### Impact

Scheduler would eventually use all available memory on the node or cgroup, causing an OOM crash.

### Root cause

Etcd does not automatically Defragment after compaction, causing unused memory to not be released.

### Solution

Every 10 minutes, each Scheduler host will check whether the total memory is twice the size of used memory and if so, will defragment that host's Etcd database.
