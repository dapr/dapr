This update includes bug fixes:

- [Update go-etcd-cron to v0.9.1](#update-go-etcd-cron-to-v091)

## Update go-etcd-cron to v0.9.1

### Problem

We had an issue with high-load Workflow executions where the Workflow scheduler would rise catastrophic errors.

### Impact

Workflows would fail to execute.

### Root cause

The go-etcd-cron library was not properly handling high-load scenarios, causing the Workflow scheduler to rise catastrophic errors.

### Solution

The go-etcd-cron library has been updated to properly handle high-load scenarios, which was fixed in https://github.com/diagridio/go-etcd-cron/pull/97
