## Highlights

### Configure retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers across Dapr APIs

Distributed applications are commonly comprised of many services, with dozens - even hundreds - of instances for any given application. These applications do not live in isolation, but are many times dependent on databases, caches, pub/subs, secret stores and other infrastructure services. With more dependencies, the likelihood of a system failure increases. For example, an instance can fail or be unresponsive due to hardware failure, database slowness, an overwhelming number of requests, application restarts/scale outs, or several other reasons. Designing and implementing your application with fault tolerance (the ability to detect, mitigate, and respond to failures) allows your application to recover to a functioning state and become self healing, and also helps prevent cascading failures all the way to your infrastructure services.

Dapr provides a capability for defining and applying [fault tolerance resiliency policies](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/) via a [resiliency spec](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/resiliency-overview/#complete-example-policy). **Resiliency** specs are saved in the same location as components specs and are applied when the Dapr sidecar starts. The sidecar determines how to apply[ resiliency policies](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/policies/) to your Dapr API calls. Within the resiliency spec, you can define policies for popular resiliency patterns, such as: 

- [Timeouts](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/policies/#timeouts)
- [Retries](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/policies/#retries)
- [Circuit breakers](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/policies/#circuit-breakers)

Policies can then be applied consistently to targets, which include:
- [Apps via service invocation](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/targets/#apps)
- [Components](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/targets/#components)
- [Actors](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/resiliency/targets/#actors)

### Observability
#### Additional component metrics
 - In order to provide increased visibility into operations, [new metrics have been added to components](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/blob/release-1.7/docs/development/dapr-metrics.md#dapr-component-metrics) including, pub/sub, bindings, state stores etc. For example, latencies when using a component or the number of times a given component has been called.

#### Dapr API call logging
- The Dapr runtime [logs events](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/troubleshooting/logs-troubleshooting/) to standard output for ease of diagnostics, for example listing components loaded at startup other runtime information. With this release you can now turn on [logging for the API calls](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/troubleshooting/api-logs-troubleshooting/) between your application and the Dapr sidecar and also see these in the output log. 

### Components
#### New stable components

The following components with stable release candidates in the previous Dapr release have graduated to **stable** designation:
- [MQTT pub/sub](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/setup-mqtt/)
- [RabbitMQ pub/sub](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/setup-rabbitmq/)
- [Azure Blob Storage binding](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/blobstorage/)
- [Azure CosmosDB binding](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/cosmosdb/)
- [Azure Service Bus Queues binding](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/servicebusqueues/)

#### New state store components

There are now a total of 22 state stores with three new ones added in this release.
- [CockroachDB state store component](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-cockroachdb/) see [1556](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/1556)
- [NATS JetStream state store component](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-jetstream-kv/) see [1422](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/1422)
- [Oracle Database state store component](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-oracledatabase/) see [1444](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/1444)

In addition, the preview Query API support has been added to the [PostgresSQL](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-postgresql/), [CockroachDB](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-cockroachdb/) and [Redis](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-redis/#querying-json-objects) state stores in [addition to the existing ones.](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/)
 

#### Updates to existing components
- The [influxdb](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/influxdb/) binding now has support for [query](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/influxdb/#query).

See the components section below for the list of numerous other fixes to components in this release.

[Note: With this release, there are now a total of 97 components including 41 bindings, 1 configuration, 8 HTTP middleware, 3 name resolution, 13 pub/sub, 8 secret stores, 23 state stores]

### Features moved from preview to stable
Several features were moved from "preview" status to "stable" status having been available for at least two releases and solicited feedback and fixes. The following features are now stable in this release:

- [Actor reentrancy](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/actors/actor-reentrancy/)
- [gRPC proxying](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/howto-invoke-services-grpc/)
- [Automatic state store encryption](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/howto-encrypt-state/) including adding new support for using 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit key sizes.


### CLI Updates
- **Kubernetes namespace support:** The [`components`](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-components/), [`configurations`](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-configurations/) and [`list`](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-list/) CLI commands now support Kubernetes namespaces when returning output.
- **Easier certificate renewal:** To ease the rollover and regeneration of new root and application certificates a [dapr mtls renew-certificate](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-mtls/dapr-mtls-export/) command has been introduced. This makes it easier to address root certificate expiry and renewal in clusters. Along with this, any CLI command that uses the Kubernetes -k option, now raises a warning message if the root certificate expiry is less than 30 days away.


### New ways to install Dapr in self hosted mode
- **Private and alternative image registries (Preview)**: In self hosted mode [the CLI `init` command can now specify any private registry to pull the container images](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-init/) required to install Dapr, as well as the ability to choose either public Dockerhub or Github repositories. This enables you to place images in trusted repositories of your choice, or pull from different purblic sources in case of image throttling.

- **Offline or airgap installation (Preview)**: By default, Dapr downloads binaries and pulls images from the network to setup the development environment. With this release, Dapr now supports offline or airgap installation using pre-downloaded artifacts, either with a Docker or slim environment. The artifacts for each Dapr release are now built into a [Dapr Installer Bundle](https://github.com/dapr/installer-bundle) which can be downloaded from the [releases in that repository](https://github.com/dapr/installer-bundle/releases). By using [this installer bundle with the Dapr CLI `init` command](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/self-hosted/self-hosted-airgap/), you can install Dapr into environments that do not have any network access.

### Performance

#### Unix Domain Sockets now available on Kubernetes

- It's now possible to use Unix Domain Sockets with Kubernetes (as well as self hosted) for increased throughput and lower latency when invoking the Dapr sidecar by using the `dapr.io/unix-domain-socket-path` [annotation](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/arguments-annotations-overview/). 

    *Note: This feature is not available on Windows, only on Linux*

## Upgrading to Dapr 1.7.0

To upgrade to this release of Dapr, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade. You know, the one where you don't get red errors on the terminal.. we all hate that, right?

### Local Machine / Self-hosted

Uninstall Dapr using the CLI you currently have installed. Note that this will remove the default $HOME/.dapr directory, binaries and all containers dapr_redis, dapr_placement and dapr_zipkin. Linux users need to run sudo if docker command needs sudo:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

For RC releases like this, download the latest and greatest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

Once you have installed the CLI, run:

```bash
dapr init --runtime-version=1.7.0
```

Wait for the update to finish,  ensure you are using the latest version of Dapr(1.7.0) with:

```bash
$ dapr --version

CLI version: 1.7.0
Runtime version: 1.7.0
```

### Kubernetes

#### Upgrading from previous version

You can perform zero-downtime upgrades using both Helm 3 and the Dapr CLI.

##### Upgrade using the CLI

Download the latest RC release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

To upgrade Dapr, run:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.7.0 -k
```

To upgrade with high availability mode:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.7.0 --enable-ha=true -k
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

##### Upgrade using Helm

To upgrade Dapr using Helm, run:

```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

helm upgrade dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.7.0 --namespace=dapr-system --wait
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

#### Starting a fresh install on a cluster

Please see [how to deploy Dapr on a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/) for a complete guide to installing Dapr on Kubernetes

You can use Helm 3 to install Dapr:
```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

kubectl create namespace dapr-system

helm install dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.7.0 --namespace dapr-system --wait
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest version of CLI:

```
dapr init --runtime-version=1.7.0 -k
```

##### Post installation

Verify the control plane pods are running and are healthy:

```
$ dapr status -k
  NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-dashboard         dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.10.0    15s  2022-03-29 13:07.39
  dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.7.0   15s  2022-03-29 13:07.39
  dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.7.0   15s  2022-03-29 13:07.39
  dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.7.0   15s  2022-03-29 13:07.39
  dapr-placement         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.7.0   15s  2022-03-29 13:07.39
```

After Dapr 1.7.0 has been installed, perform a rolling restart for your deployments to pick up the new version of the sidecar.
This can be done with:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<deployment-name>
```

## Breaking Changes

### Components
- In this release the `value` field has been removed from the key name in the state management Query API as part of the ongoing feedback on this preview feature.
    - **FIXED** statestore preview Query API: Remove 'value' prefix from the key names in query JSON [1490](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/1490)
- This release include the breaking change to the MongoDB store [as described in v1.6.1 release notes](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases/tag/v1.6.1) to address a data serialization problem.
  - **FIXED** MongoDB state store: Removes MongoDB bson artifacts from JSON value output [1582](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/issues/1582)
- If you use "/" as part of your method invocation, this release will affect those service invocations:
  - **FIXED** Method invocation / Dapr automatically decodes %2f in URL [4008](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/4008)

### Java SDK
- **REMOVED** Deprecated builder classes [601](https://github.com/dapr/java-sdk/issues/601)

## Deprecation Notices
- Starting in Dapr 1.9, `content-type` will no longer default to `text/plain` if not explicitly provided as a header for HTTP invocations. Users are recommended to turn on this new behavior via the new [preview feature](https://v1-7.docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-preview-features/) to evaluate the impact of this change.
