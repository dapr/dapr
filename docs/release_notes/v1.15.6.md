## Fix Actor memory leak

### Problem

Running Actor or Workflow workloads would see the daprd process consume more and more memory over time.

### Impact

Running Actor or Workflow for long enough periods of time would see the daprd process consume all available memory, leading to an OOM crash.

### Root cause

The Actor locking mechanism would not release object memory after use, in the case where the daprd it calling a remote Actor.

### Solution

Defer Actor message locking to only the daprd which is hosting that Actor ID to ensure the lock object memory is always released after use.

## Fix Workflow state store contention

### Problem

Running Workflows in high throughput scenarios would see contention on processing or blocking Workflow state store operations.

### Impact

Degraded performance of Workflow operations, leading to increased latency and potential timeouts.

### Root cause

Circular Placement locking of Actor Workflow state operations.

### Solution

Remove Placement locking in Workflow state operations as it is already locked at the Actor level.

## Update Max Concurrent Workflow Operations

### Problem

Workflows would experience degraded performance in high throughput scenarios.

### Impact

Workflows would be limited in the number of concurrent operations they could handle, leading to increased latency and potential timeouts.


### Root cause

The default value for `maxConcurrentWorkflowInvocations` and `maxConcurrentActivityInvocations` was set to 1000, which could lead to performance issues in high throughput scenarios.

### Solution

Increase the default value for `maxConcurrentWorkflowInvocations` and `maxConcurrentActivityInvocations` to max int32 value, allowing for more concurrent operations to be processed without contention.

## Remove client-side rate limiter from injector

### Problem

The injector was using a client-side rate limiter that could cause throttling issues in production environments with high-throughput scenarios.

### Impact

Degraded performance and potential service disruptions when the injector was under heavy load.

### Root cause

The client-side rate limiter in the injector was unnecessarily restricting operations, causing bottlenecks in high-traffic scenarios.

### Solution

Remove the client-side rate limiter from the injector to allow for better performance and eliminate unnecessary throttling in production environments.

## Allow non-stream Workflow Schedule

### Problem

Attempting to schedule a Workflow on a daprd with no Workflow listener stream would hang.

### Impact

Attempting to schedule a Workflow on a daprd with no Workflow listener stream would hang indefinitely.

### Root cause

The daprd would wait until a Workflow listener stream was established before processing the schedule request.

### Solution

Allow scheduling of Workflows without requiring a Workflow listener stream to be established first. This allows for immediate processing of the schedule request.

## Fix Placement reconnection during leader shutdown

### Problem

Daprd would fail to find the Placement leader host.

### Impact

Actors (or Workflows) would fail to continue to function.

### Root cause

The daprd DNS record set used to round robin the Placement hosts would not be refreshed in the event the leader host was shutdown.

### Solution

Add a retry mechanism to the daprd to refresh the DNS record set for the Placement hosts, ensuring that it can always find the current leader host even during leader shutdown events.

## Scheduler connect after Placement dissemination

### Problem

Connecting a Workflow stream when there is worked queued in the system would cause a large number errors.

### Impact

Connecting a Workflow stream when there is work queued in the system would cause a large number of errors, leading to degraded performance and potential timeouts on existing Workflows.

### Root cause

Daprd would connect to Scheduler to receive Workflow work before Placement had disseminated.

### Solution

Ensure that the daprd connects to the Scheduler only after Placement has disseminated, preventing errors and ensuring that the daprd is ready to process Workflow work without contention.
