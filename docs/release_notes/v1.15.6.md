## Fix Actor memory leak

### Problem

Running Actor or Workflow workloads would see the daprd process consume more and more memory over time.

### Impact

Running Actor or Workflow for long enough periods of time would see the daprd process consume all available memory, leading to an OOM crash.

### Root cause

The Actor locking mechanism would not release object memory after use, in the case where the daprd it calling a remote Actor.

### Solution

Defer Actor message locking to only the daprd which is hosting that Actor ID to ensure the lock object memory is always released after use.

## Fix Workflow state store contention

### Problem

Running Workflows in high throughput scenarios would see contention on processing or blocking Workflow state store operations.

### Impact

Degraded performance of Workflow operations, leading to increased latency and potential timeouts.

### Root cause

Circular Placement locking of Actor Workflow state operations.

### Solution

Remove Placement locking in Workflow state operations as it is already locked at the Actor level.

## Update Max Concurrent Workflow Operations

### Problem

Workflows would experience degraded performance in high throughput scenarios.

### Impact

Workflows would be limited in the number of concurrent operations they could handle, leading to increased latency and potential timeouts.


### Root cause

The default value for `maxConcurrentWorkflowInvocations` and `maxConcurrentActivityInvocations` was set to 1000, which could lead to performance issues in high throughput scenarios.

### Solution

Increase the default value for `maxConcurrentWorkflowInvocations` and `maxConcurrentActivityInvocations` to max int32 value, allowing for more concurrent operations to be processed without contention.

## Remove client-side rate limiter from injector

### Problem

The injector was using a client-side rate limiter that could cause throttling issues in production environments with high-throughput scenarios.

### Impact

Degraded performance and potential service disruptions when the injector was under heavy load.

### Root cause

The client-side rate limiter in the injector was unnecessarily restricting operations, causing bottlenecks in high-traffic scenarios.

### Solution

Remove the client-side rate limiter from the injector to allow for better performance and eliminate unnecessary throttling in production environments.
