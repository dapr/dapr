This update includes bug fixes:

- [Fix Actor memory leak](#fix-actor-memory-leak)
- [Fix Workflow state store contention](#fix-workflow-state-store-contention)

## Fix Actor memory leak

### Problem

Running Actor or Workflow workloads would see the daprd process consume more and more memory over time.

### Impact

Running Actor or Workflow for long enough periods of time would see the daprd process consume all available memory, leading to an OOM crash.

### Root cause

The Actor locking mechanism would not release object memory after use, in the case where the daprd it calling a remote Actor.

### Solution

Defer Actor message locking to only the daprd which is hosting that Actor ID to ensure the lock object memory is always released after use.

## Fix Workflow state store contention

### Problem

Running Workflows in high throughput scenarios would see contention on processing or blocking Workflow state store operations.

### Impact

Degraded performance of Workflow operations, leading to increased latency and potential timeouts.

### Root cause

Circular Placement locking of Actor Workflow state operations.

### Solution

Remove Placement locking in Workflow state operations as it is already locked at the Actor level.
