# Dapr 1.14

We're excited to announce the release of Dapr 1.14!

We would like to extend our thanks to all the new and existing contributors who helped make this release happen.

If you're new to Dapr, visit the [getting started](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/) page and familiarize yourself with Dapr.

Docs have been updated with all the new features and changes of this release. To get started with new capabilities introduced in this release, go to the [Concepts](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/) and the [Developing applications](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/).

> **Note: This release contains a few [breaking changes](#Breaking-changes).**

See [this](#Upgrading-to-Dapr-1.14) section on upgrading Dapr to version 1.14.

## Highlights

These are the new feature highlights for the v1.14 release:

### Jobs API and Scheduler service (preview)
Many applications require job scheduling, or the need to take an action in the future. The new jobs API is an orchestrator for scheduling these future jobs, either at a specific time or for a specific interval. For example job scheduling is useful in scenarios such as automated database backups, regular Data Processing and ETL, email notifications, maintenance tasks and system updates and batch processing to name a few.

The Dapr’s Jobs API ensures the tasks represented in these types of scenarios are performed consistently and reliably, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of errors. Think of this as a scalable version of the popular Dapr [Cron Binding](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/cron/), now as a first class API available via the Dapr SDKs.

You can read more in the [Jobs API overview](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/jobs/jobs-overview/) documentation, or dive into a [Quickstart Go code example](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/getting-started/quickstarts/jobs-quickstart/). Support for Jobs is also in the alpha Rust-SDK!

#### Scheduler service (preview)
The [Scheduler service](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/concepts/dapr-services/scheduler/) is a new [control plane service](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/concepts/overview/#kubernetes) used to schedule jobs, running in self-hosted mode or on Kubernetes. It is installed by when using Helm or the Dapr CLI and is the service responsible for managing the scheduled jobs.

### Increased throughput and scalability for actors and workflows (preview)

The new Scheduler service can optionally be used as the backend for actor reminders and enables increased throughput and lower latency for both actors and workflows. To use the scheduler service for actors and workflows, simply [enable it in a Dapr Configuration](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/operations/configuration/preview-features/#enabling-a-preview-feature) resource like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: featureconfig
spec:
  features:
    - name: SchedulerReminders
      enabled: true
```

*Important note: Existing reminder data is not be compatible with the scheduler service. The scheduler service should be used only for new actor and workflow reminders*

### Streaming subscriptions (preview)
[Streaming subscriptions are a new type of subscription written in code](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/subscription-methods/). Streaming subscriptions are dynamic, meaning they allow for adding or removing subscriptions at runtime. They do not require a subscription HTTP endpoint in your application (which is required by the current programmatic and declarative subscriptions), making them easy to configure in code. Streaming subscriptions also do not require an app to be configured with the sidecar to receive messages. These are an [incredibly easy way to configure topic subscriptions](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/subscription-methods/#streaming-subscriptions) for your app. In this release streaming subscriptions are available in the Go SDK.

### Actor multi-tenancy with namespacing
Namespacing in Dapr provides [isolation](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/concepts/isolation-concept/), and thus multi-tenancy. With [actor namespacing](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/actors/namespaced-actors/), the same actor type can be deployed into different namespaces. You can then call instances of these actors within the same namespace. Each namespaced actor deployment must use its own separate state store, especially if the same actor type is deployed into different namespaces.


### HTTP metrics filtering with path matching
When invoking Dapr using HTTP, [metrics](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/operations/observability/metrics/metrics-overview/) are created for each requested method by default. For example metrics include error rates, latency and throughput numbers. This can result in a high number of metrics being reported, known as high cardinality, which can impact memory usage and CPU for your application.

[HTTP metric path matching](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/operations/observability/metrics/metrics-overview/#optimizing-http-metrics-reporting-with-path-matching) allows you to manage and control the cardinality, or the amount, of HTTP metrics in Dapr. This is an aggregation of metrics, so rather than having a metric for each event, you can reduce the number of metrics events and report an overall number.



### Outbox message projections (stable)
The [transactional outbox](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/howto-outbox/) feature allows you to commit state and then send a message in a single transaction and can be used with a broad combination of pub/sub brokers and databases. The [transactional outbox](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/howto-outbox/) is now stable in v1.14 release.

Now in this release, when using the [outbox pattern](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/howto-outbox/), you can [send a different payload to the pub/sub broker](https://v1-14.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/howto-outbox/#shape-the-outbox-pattern-message) than the one saved in the database. These are called outbox message projections, and can be shaped in any way you need.


### Service invocation for non-Dapr endpoints (stable)
The ability to invoke non-Dapr endpoints using the Dapr [Service invocation API](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/howto-invoke-non-dapr-endpoints/)is now stable.

### Dapr Shared ([new preview repo in Dapr org](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-shared/blob/main/README.md))
Although not part of the Dapr runtime v1.14 release, [Dapr Shared provides alternative deployment choices for Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-dapr-shared/).

Dapr, by default, is injected as a sidecar to enable the Dapr APIs for your applications for the best availability and reliability. Dapr Shared enables two alternative deployment strategies to create Dapr applications using a **Kubernetes Daemonset for a per-node deployment** or a **Deployment for a per-cluster** deployment.

For example, Dapr Shared can be used to reduce resource usage in a cluster or to make a simpler testing deployment environment.

###  Python SDK updates
- The python-sdk now has support for the cryptography API.
- The python-sdk now supports actor state TTL (timeouts)

## Upgrading to Dapr 1.14

To upgrade to this release of Dapr, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade. You know, the one where you don't get red errors on the terminal... we all hate that, right?

### Local Machine / Self-hosted

Uninstall Dapr using the CLI you currently have installed. Note that this will remove the default $HOME/.dapr directory, binaries and all containers dapr_redis, dapr_placement and dapr_zipkin. Linux users need to run sudo if docker command needs sudo:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

For RC releases like this, download the latest and greatest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

Once you have installed the CLI, run:

```bash
dapr init --runtime-version=1.14
```

Wait for the update to finish,  ensure you are using the latest version of Dapr(1.14) with:

```bash
$ dapr --version

CLI version: 1.14
Runtime version: 1.14
```

### Kubernetes

#### Upgrading from previous version

You can perform zero-downtime upgrades using both Helm 3 and the Dapr CLI.

##### Upgrade using the CLI

We've got some handy install scripts available: https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/ making sure to specify `1.14.0` as the CLI version.

Alternatively - download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

To upgrade Dapr, run:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.14 -k
```

To upgrade with high availability mode:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.14 --enable-ha=true -k
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

##### Upgrade using Helm

To upgrade Dapr using Helm, run:

```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

helm upgrade dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.14 --namespace=dapr-system --wait
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

#### Starting a fresh install on a cluster

Please see [how to deploy Dapr on a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/) for a complete guide to installing Dapr on Kubernetes

You can use Helm 3 to install Dapr:
```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

kubectl create namespace dapr-system

helm install dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.14 --namespace dapr-system --wait
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest version of CLI:

```
dapr init --runtime-version=1.14 -k
```

##### Post installation

Verify the control plane pods are running and are healthy:

```
$ dapr status -k
  NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.14   15s  2024-07-23 13:07.39
  dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.14   15s  2024-07-23 13:07.39
  dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.14   15s  2024-07-23 13:07.39
  dapr-placement         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.14   15s  2024-07-23 13:07.39
  dapr-scheduler         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.14   15s  2024-07-23 13:07.39
```

After Dapr 1.14 has been installed, perform a rolling restart for your deployments to pick up the new version of the sidecar.
This can be done with:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<deployment-name>
```

## Breaking changes

### Java SDK
- **ADDED** State serializer content type when saving actor states. [1033](https://github.com/dapr/java-sdk/pull/1033)
  - This change can make data to be saved in a different format in the state store, causing previous data not to be read. It is recommended for users to test the new SDK using non-production state store where data was saved with the previous SDK version to confirm it will not cause issues.

### Actor placement (cross-namespace actor invocation)
Actors are now namespaced, meaning that cross-namespace actor invocation is no longer supported. You must ensure that all actor invocations occur within the same namespace.

## Deprecation Notices

None.
