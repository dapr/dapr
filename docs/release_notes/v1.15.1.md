# Dapr 1.15.1

This update includes a fix for https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/8537.

## Fixes Dapr not honoring max-body-size when invoking actors

### Problem

When an actor client attempts to invoke an actor with a payload size larger than 4Mb, the call fails with `rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than max`.

### Impact

Users were unable to send actor messages with payloads larger than 4Mb.

### Root cause

The Dapr actor gRPC client did not honor the max-body-size parameter that is passed to `daprd`.

### Solution

The DApr actor gRPC client is configured with the proper gRPC call options.
