- [Fix Dapr not honoring max-body-size when invoking actors](#fixes-dapr-not-honoring-max-body-size-when-invoking-actors)
- [Fix sending Actor Reentrancy ID HTTP header when disabled](#fix-sending-actor-reentrancy-id-http-header-when-disabled)

## Fix Dapr not honoring max-body-size when invoking actors

### Problem

Issue reported [here](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/8537).
When an actor client attempts to invoke an actor with a payload size larger than 4Mb, the call fails with `rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: received message larger than max`.

### Impact

Users were unable to send actor messages with payloads larger than 4Mb.

### Root cause

The Dapr actor gRPC client did not honor the max-body-size parameter that is passed to `daprd`.

### Solution

The Dapr actor gRPC client is configured with the proper gRPC call options.

## Fix sending Actor Reentrancy ID HTTP header when disabled

### Problem

Calling `this.StateManager.TryGetStateAsync()` in the DotNet Actor SDK would return stale data during some invocation scenarios.

### Impact

The latest Actor state data was not being correctly returned during some Actor invocation scenarios using the DotNet Actor SDK.

### Root cause

When Reentrancy was disabled, the Actor Reentrancy ID HTTP header was still being sent to Actor HTTP servers.
The DotNet SDK uses the existence of this HTTP header in logic to determine what state should be returned to the Actor.

### Solution

Don't send the Actor Reentrancy ID HTTP header (`"Dapr-Reentrancy-Id"`) when Reentrancy is disabled.
