# Dapr 1.10.6

This patch release contains fixes for 3 bugs.

## Fixed Actor Timers/Reminders not being unmarshaled correctly

### Problem

A regression introduced in Dapr 1.10.0 caused actor reminders and timers not to deserialize its data when being triggered.

### Impact

The issue impacts all users on Dapr 1.10.5.

### Root cause

A change introduced in Dapr 1.10.0 accidentally changed how reminders and timers were sent to the application, causing SDKs not to deserialized them.

### Solution

Fix the issue in runtime code.

## Fixed unserializing reminder period due to null-y values by MongoDB

### Problem

When unmarshling reminder from MongoDB, some of the attributes have null-equivalent values that should not be parsed. Dapr 1.10 added this regression for MongoDB.

### Impact

The issue impacts users on Dapr 1.10.x to use reminders with MongoDB.

### Root cause

Accidental regression on refactor of reminders code.

### Solution

Fixed the runtime code to support more null-equivalent values.

## Fixed an issue in Kafka components with SASL authentication

### Problem

When attempting to connect to Kafka compatible services like Azure Event Hubs using SALS authentication the connection fails with the message "client has run out of available brokers to talk to."

### Impact

The issue impacts users on Dapr 1.10.x who use Kafka components to connect to Azure Event Hubs. Other Kafka compatible services may be impacted too.

### Root cause

The latest versions (1.38.X) of the shopify/sarama kafka library introduced this problem.

### Solution

Downgrading the shopify/sarama library to release 1.37.2 resolves this problem. An issue with the maintainers of the sarama library has been created for further investigation.
