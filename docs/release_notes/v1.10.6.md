# Dapr 1.10.6

This patch release contains fixes for 2 bugs.

## Fixed Actor Timers/Reminders not being unmarshaled correctly

### Problem

A regression introduced in Dapr 1.10.0 caused actor reminders and timers not to deserialize its data when being triggered.

### Impact

The issue impacts all users on Dapr 1.10.5.

### Root cause

A change introduced in Dapr 1.10.0 accidentally changed how reminders and timers were sent to the application, causing SDKs not to deserialized them.

### Solution

Fix the issue in runtime code.

## Fixed unserializing reminder period due to null-y values by MongoDB

### Problem

When unmarshling reminder from MongoDB, some of the attributes have null-equivalent values that should not be parsed. Dapr 1.10 added this regression for MongoDB.

### Impact

The issue impacts users on Dapr 1.10.x to use reminders with MongoDB.

### Root cause

Accidental regression on refactor of reminders code.

### Solution

Fixed the runtime code to support more null-equivalent values.
