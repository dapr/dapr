## Security: API token authentication bypass in HTTP endpoints

### Problem

[Security advisory](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/security/advisories/GHSA-59m6-82qm-vqgj)

A high-severity vulnerability has been found in Dapr that allows bypassing [API token authentication](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/security/api-token/), which is used by the Dapr sidecar to authenticate calls coming from the application, with a well-crafted HTTP request.

### Impact

The vulnerability impacts all users on Dapr <=1.9.7, <=1.10.9 and <=1.11.2 who are using API token authentication.

### Root cause

The Dapr sidecar allowed all requests containing `/healthz` in the URL (including query string) to bypass API token authentication.

### Solution

We have changed the API token authentication middleware to allow bypassing the authentication only for healthcheck endpoints more strictly.
