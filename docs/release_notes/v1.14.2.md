## Fix nil map error on Placement Service state restore from an older version

### Problem

When a Placement Service instance using on disk logs was upgraded to 1.14 in some cases we would get a nil map error and the instance would not start.

### Impact

Dapr Placement Service instance would not start.

### Root cause

Restoring the old format would override the state saved in Raft with a struct that wasn't properly initialised.

### Solution

Initialize the struct properly when restoring the old format.

## Fix non-URL encoded Kafka headers causing event delivery to fail over HTTP

### Problem

When Kafka headers are present that are not URL encoded, the event delivery to the app will fail with a retriable error.

### Impact

Messages cannot be delivered to the app.

### Root cause

Lack of URL encoding on header values from Kafka.

### Solution

Add URL encoding to Kafka headers.

## Fix AWS Secret Manager and Parameter Store initialization

### Problem

If users had IAM policies in place that only allowed access to specific secrets, the initialization of the AWS secret manager and parameter store components would fail.

### Impact

Components could not be initialized.

### Root cause

There was a redundant check in initialization that tried to read a random secret which caused the init to fail if a policy was present to only allow reading specific secrets.

### Solution

The redundant check was removed.
