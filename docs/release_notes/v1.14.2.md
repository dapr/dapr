# Dapr 1.14.2

## Fix Memory Leak when running Workflows

### Problem

When using workflows, daprd would increase in memory consumption indefinitely, eventually causing daprd to crash from a Out Of Memory Kill (OOM Kill),

### Impact

Daprd would consume extra resources from the host, and periodically become unavailable and disrupt running tasks.

### Root cause

The actor runtime in Daprd was not releasing memory of workflow actors, and the associated workflow state (history, inbox, etc.).

### Solution

The actor runtime now correctly releases the workflow state once that workflow has reached a terminal state.

## Fix nil map error on Placement Service state restore from an older version

### Problem

When a Placement Service instance using on disk logs was upgraded to 1.14 in some cases we would get a nil map error and the instance would not start.

### Impact

Dapr Placement Service instance would not start.

### Root cause

Restoring the old format would override the state saved in Raft with a struct that wasn't properly initialised.

### Solution

Initialize the struct properly when restoring the old format.

## Fix non-URL encoded Kafka headers causing event delivery to fail over HTTP

### Problem

When Kafka headers are present that are not URL encoded, the event delivery to the app will fail with a retriable error.

### Impact

Messages cannot be delivered to the app.

### Root cause

Lack of URL encoding on header values from Kafka.

### Solution

Add URL encoding to Kafka headers.

## Fix AWS Secret Manager and Parameter Store initialization

### Problem

If users had IAM policies in place that only allowed access to specific secrets, the initialization of the AWS secret manager and parameter store components would fail.

### Impact

Components could not be initialized.

### Root cause

There was a redundant check in initialization that tried to read a random secret which caused the init to fail if a policy was present to only allow reading specific secrets.

### Solution

The redundant check was removed.

## Fix Kafka Avro validation for null values

### Problem

When publishing a message containing a null byte array with Kafka and Avro validation enabled, the message would be rejected when it shouldn't be.

### Impact

A message could not be sent.

### Root cause

There was a missing validation logic for null byte arrays that would allow the message to continue processing.

### Solution

The missing validation logic was added.

## Fix Kafka edge case of lost messages upon process termination

### Problem

In certain cases, Dapr would drop a Kafka message when it should have been retried if the `daprd` process is abruptly terminated.

### Impact

A message would not be retried upon failure.

### Root cause

Message processing logic moved on to process the next message instead of exiting when the session context was done.

### Solution

The code was changed to handle session context exiting prior to processing the next message.

## Fix Outbox not sending messages to the user topic

### Problem

If outbox was being used and a publisher didn't have an app channel open or the subscriber didn't have access to the transactional state store, then outbox messages would not be published.

### Impact

Outbox messages could not be sent.

### Root cause

Faulty logic that required Dapr to have an app channel in order to subscribe to the internal topics.

### Solution

Enable Dapr to subscribe to internal topics without needing an app channel.
