## Fix nil map error on Placement Service state restore from an older version

### Problem

When a Placement Service instance using on disk logs was upgraded to 1.14 in some cases we would get a nil map error and the instance would not start.

### Impact

Dapr Placement Service instance would not start.

### Root cause

Restoring the old format would override the state saved in Raft with a struct that wasn't properly initialised.

### Solution

Initialize the struct properly when restoring the old format.
