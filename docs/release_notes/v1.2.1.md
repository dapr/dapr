## Fixes

* Container order change clashes with readiness probes (https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/3304)

### Overview

This is a fix for a regression caused by making Dapr the first container in the pod during injection, which causes a long pod startup delay in cases where apps have readiness probes and has Dapr waiting for the app to respond on a given port.

This causes Dapr to detect the app is running only when the failure threshold of the user app is met.

You should upgrade to this version if all the following conditions are met:

1. You are using Dapr on Kubernetes
2. Your app has readiness probes
3. Your app configured a `dapr.io/app-port` setting
