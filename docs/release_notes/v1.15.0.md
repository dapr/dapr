## Highlights
These are the v1.15 release highlights:

### Dapr Workflow (stable)
Dapr workflow makes it easy to write long running stateful applications using durable execution. You can try out Dapr workflow with the [Quickstart Samples](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/getting-started/quickstarts/workflow-quickstart/). The ability to author and run [workflows](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/) is now stable. This includes the Dapr runtime along with the Dapr .NET, Java, Python, Go and Javascript SDKs.

The workflow runtime engine has undergone a major overwrite to achieve substantial performance and scalability improvements, as well as reliability and stability traits that are required to run mission critical apps at massive scale. Workflows now support dynamically scaling your Workflow applications from 0 to many replicas, whilst maintaining durability of your tasks at runtime.

### Dapr Actors

The Actor runtime engine has had a rewrite in its implementation. Although no changes have been made to the API surface of Actors, this overhaul significantly improves the reliability of handling Actors at scale and in dynamically scaling environments. This work has also been instrumental in making the, now stable, Workflows engine dynamic and durable.

The Actor runtime implementation is now capable of being extended upon to implement new highly requested Actor APIs, or even targeting new Actor targets beyond your app and Workflows in future.

### Scheduler Service (stable)
The [Scheduler service](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/concepts/dapr-services/scheduler/) is the control plane service used to schedule jobs, running in self-hosted mode or on Kubernetes. It is installed when using the Dapr CLI and is the service responsible for managing scheduled jobs. The Scheduler service is now stable

- ***Note***: Prior to Dapr v1.15, actor reminders were run using the Placement service by default. Now, by default in v1.15, the `SchedulerReminders` feature flag is set to true, and all new actor reminders you create are run using the Scheduler service. When you deploy Dapr v1.15, *any existing actor reminders are migrated from the Placement service to the Scheduler service as a one time operation for each actor type*. You can prevent this migration by setting the `SchedulerReminders` flag to `false` in the application configuration file for the actor type. See [Scheduler Actor Reminders](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/concepts/dapr-services/scheduler/#actor-reminders)

### Conversation API (alpha)
A new Conversation API (alpha) reduces the complexity of interacting with large language models (LLM) at scale, providing a consistent API to talk to LLM providers. With the Conversation API, you can:
- Send prompt and responses LLMs including Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Hugging Face, Mistral, OpenAI and DeepSeek
- Enable critical performance and security functionality, including [prompt caching](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/conversation/conversation-overview/#prompt-caching) to reduce the number of calls and [PII obfuscation](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/conversation/conversation-overview/#personally-identifiable-information-pii-obfuscation) to scrub PII data.

The Go, .NET, and Rust SDKs have the conversation API implemented as part of this release. As with all APIs, Dapr provides observability by issuing metrics for your LLM interactions.

Learn more about the [Conversation API](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/conversation/conversation-overview/), or dive into a [.NET or Go Quickstart](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/getting-started/quickstarts/conversation-quickstart/).

## SDK Improvements
### .NET SDK
The .NET SDK added support for the [Jobs](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/dotnet/dotnet-jobs/), [Conversation](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/dotnet/dotnet-ai/) and [streaming pub/sub](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/dotnet/dotnet-messaging/dotnet-messaging-pubsub-howto/) APIs.
- Support for services targeting .NET 9.

### Python SDK
The Python SDK added support for [streaming pub/sub](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/python/python-client/#streaming-message-subscription) APIs and the [Conversation API](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/python/python-client/#conversation-alpha).
- Added [Mock actors](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/python/python-actor/#mock-actor-testing) for unit testing.
- The Dapr Client workflow functions were deprecated in favor of the [DaprWorkflowClient](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/sdks/python/python-sdk-extensions/python-workflow-ext/python-workflow). (***TBD*** need to point to docs/example)
- The default timeout for `wait_for_orchestration_start` and `wait_for_orchestration_completion` was changed from 60 seconds to no timeout
- Support for Python 3.8 was removed and support for Python 3.13 was added.

### Java SDK
The Java SDK added a Spring Boot integration, including Spring Boot Starters for interacting with the Dapr APIs and testing capabilities using Testcontainers. The Spring Boot integration now supports:
- DaprClient and DaprWorkflowClient bean injection
- Spring Data CrudRepository support using Dapr StateStore + Bindings
- Spring Messaging support using Dapr PubSub APIs
- Dapr Workflows support with automatic Workflows and Activities registration and support for bean injection
- Testcontainers integration providing DaprContainer and PlacementServiceContainer

### Javascript SDK
The JavaScript SDK added support for the Pause, Resume and SetStatus methods on the Workflow API. Progress is being made to improve the JavaScript SDK documentation.

### Go SDK
- The Go SDK added support for the [Conversation](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/release-1.15/conversation/go/sdk) API.
- Dead Letter Topic support for subscriptions is now available.
- Workflow authoring and management with this SDK are 'stable'.
  - Retry policies have been added.
  - Custom statuses on workflows can be set.
  - Purge options are now supported.
  - An ID re-use policy can now be applied.
- Streaming subscriptions now re-connect automatically on unknown/unavailable grpc connection statuses.

### Rust SDK (alpha)
The Rust SDK added support for the Conversation API support. Progress is being made in other areas towards a refactor for beta/stable state.

## CLI and Env Vars
- [Ability to inject secrets as env variables](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/operations/configuration/environment-variables-secrets/) into the Dapr sidecar that may be need by components etc.
- [Multi-App Run](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/local-development/multi-app-dapr-run/multi-app-overview/) has a new setting for the `containerImagePullPolicy` on Kubernetes

## Components

## Upgrading to Dapr 1.15

To upgrade to this release of Dapr, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade. You know, the one where you don't get red errors on the terminal.. we all hate that, right?

### Local Machine / Self-hosted

Uninstall Dapr using the CLI you currently have installed. Note that this will remove the default $HOME/.dapr directory, binaries and all containers dapr_redis, dapr_placement and dapr_zipkin. Linux users need to run sudo if docker command needs sudo:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

For RC releases like this, download the latest and greatest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

Once you have installed the CLI, run:

```bash
dapr init
```

Wait for the update to finish,  ensure you are using the latest version of Dapr(1.15.0) with:

```bash
$ dapr --version

CLI version: 1.15.0
Runtime version: 1.15.0
```

### Kubernetes

#### Upgrading from previous version

You can perform zero-downtime upgrades using both Helm 3 and the Dapr CLI.

##### Upgrade using the CLI

Download the latest RC release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

To upgrade Dapr, run:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.15.0 -k
```

To upgrade with high availability mode:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.15.0 --enable-ha=true -k
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

##### Upgrade using Helm

To upgrade Dapr using Helm, run:

```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

helm upgrade dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.15.0 --namespace=dapr-system --wait
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

#### Starting a fresh install on a cluster

Please see [how to deploy Dapr on a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/) for a complete guide to installing Dapr on Kubernetes

You can use Helm 3 to install Dapr:
```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

kubectl create namespace dapr-system

helm install dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.15.0 --namespace dapr-system --wait
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest version of CLI:

```
dapr init --runtime-version=1.15.0 -k
```

##### Post installation

Verify the control plane pods are running and are healthy:

```
$ dapr status -k
  NAME                          NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-sidecar-injector         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.15.0   15s  2025-01-31 13:07.39
  dapr-sentry                   dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.15.0   15s  2025-01-31 13:07.39
  dapr-operator                 dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.15.0   15s  2025-01-31 13:07.39
  dapr-placement                dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.15.0   15s  2025-01-31 13:07.39
  dapr-scheduler-server         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.15.0   15s  2025-01-31 13:07.39
```

After Dapr 1.15.0 has been installed, perform a rolling restart for your deployments to pick up the new version of the sidecar.
This can be done with:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<deployment-name>
```

## Breaking Changes

### Scheduler Service
When upgrading from Dapr 1.14 to 1.15, the existing data directory will be removed, resulting in the loss of all jobs and, if the [`SchedulerReminders`](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-preview-features/) preview feature is enabled, actor reminders as well. In Dapr 1.15, the Scheduler is reaching Stable status and this upgrade introduces significant improvements, but also requires a fresh start. To avoid losing this data permanently, you can create a snapshot of the embedded etcd instance (within the Scheduler Service) using the `etcdctl` tool before upgrading. For example:
```
kubectl port-forward svc/dapr-scheduler-server 23879:2379
etcdctl --endpoints=http://localhost:23879 snapshot save snapshot.db
```
Then you can restore the snapshot in a local etcd cluster following the instructions in the [etcd docs](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/recovery/#restoring-a-cluster).

### Downgrading from 1.15
When downgrading Dapr from 1.15 to previous Dapr versions on Kubernetes, the Scheduler service will not be able to successfully roll the `dapr-scheduler-server` StatefulSet, this is due to the Scheduler service updated the communication between hosts to use mTLS, introduced in PR [8395](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/8395)
The old Scheduler service pods must be manually deleted to fix the issue.
```
kubectl delete -n dapr-system pods/dapr-scheduler-server-0
kubectl delete -n dapr-system pods/dapr-scheduler-server-1
kubectl delete -n dapr-system pods/dapr-scheduler-server-2
```    


### .NET SDK
#### Dapr Configuration
The original implementation of the `ConfigurationProvider` used in Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration maintains the configuration values in an [explicitly case-insensitive manner](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/b8bc661a7429baa89070f3bee636b7fbc1309489/src/runtime/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/src/ConfigurationProvider.cs#L24). In our `DaprConfigurationStoreProvider`, the returned configuration keys were not compared in a case-insensitive manner which led to a [reported inconsistency](https://github.com/dapr/dotnet-sdk/issues/934) in this behavior. Keys are [now compared](https://github.com/dapr/dotnet-sdk/pull/935) in a case-insensitive manner as one would expect when also utilizing the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` library.

#### .NET Version Support
The release of Dapr v1.15 features support for .NET 6, .NET 8 and .NET 9, except `Dapr.Workflows` which is only compatible with .NET 7, .NET 8 and .NET 9.

Since .NET 6 and .NET 7 are no longer actively supported, per the [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core#lifecycle), the release of Dapr v1.16 will only include support for .NET 8 and .NET 9 across all packages.


### Java SDK
- **RESOLVED** Bump supported Spring Boot baseline to version 3.2.x [1050](https://github.com/dapr/java-sdk/pull/1050)

## Deprecation Notices

### Workflows
As part of workflows going to stable, the ineffective workflow methods provided in the Dapr Client are deprecated, please use the provided dedicated workflow client in each SDK going forwards for orchestrating your workflows.

### Arguments and annotations
`http-read-buffer-size` and `http-max-request-size` darpd arguments are deprecated and replaced with `read-buffer-size` and `max-body-size`. See https://github.com/dapr/docs/pull/4401, https://github.com/dapr/cli/pull/1490 and [annotations reference](https://v1-15.docs.dapr.io/reference/arguments-annotations-overview/)
