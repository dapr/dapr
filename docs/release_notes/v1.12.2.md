# Dapr 1.12.2

This patch release contains bug fixes:

- [Fixed mTLS configuration](#fixed-mtls-configuration)

## Fixed mTLS configuration

### Problem

The mTLS configuration was always enabled for Dapr sidecards in Kubernetes, regardless of the `daprsystem` configuration.

### Impact

Users on Dapr 1.12.1 could not disable mTLS for Dapr sidecars in Kubernetes.

### Root cause

The `daprsystem` configuration was not being read correctly by the sidecar injector.

### Solution

The `daprsystem` configuration is now read correctly by the sidecar injector and the mTLS option is correctly set for Dapr sidecars in Kubernetes.
