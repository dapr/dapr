## Fixes daprd not being able to connect to placement on k8s

### Problem

When running dapr in high availability mode on Kubernetes, daprd would not be able to connect to the placement service after failure and re-election of a Placement leader.

### Impact

The dapr sidecar would not be able to connect to the placement service, and would not be able to receive the actor placement tables.

### Root cause

The connection to the failed placement leader was being properly closed, but not set to nil, so it was being reused.

### Solution

The additional check was removed.
