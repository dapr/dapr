## Fix content type metadata from query for outbox transactions

### Problem

Outbox transactions were not respecting the metadata in the transaction request.
For example, content type specified in the metadata was not being applied and the message was being sent as plain text.

### Impact

Outbox transactions were not respecting metadata.
Cloudevents Middleware was unable to parse the metadata, resulting in 415 error codes.

### Root cause

Metadata in the request was not being applied to the transaction.

### Solution

Read the metadata from the request and apply them to the transaction.
