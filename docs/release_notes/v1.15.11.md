This update includes bug fixes:

- [Workflow orchestrator would not retry after error](#workflow-orchestrator-would-not-retry-after-error)

## Workflow orchestrator would not retry after error

### Problem

A workflow would become in a frozen state after an error occurred and state did not change after a retry.

### Impact

Workflows would become stuck indefinitely after an error, until restart.

### Root cause

The workflow orchestrator processor would not retry a work item in the event of a orchestrator error if the state of the workflow did not change after the retry.

### Solution

The workflow orchestrator processor will now retry a work item in the event of an orchestrator error, even if the state of the workflow did not change after the retry.
