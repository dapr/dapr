# Dapr 1.16.6

This update includes bug fixes:

- [Fixed sidecar injector incorrectly logging and recording metrics for non-Dapr applications](#fixed-sidecar-injector-incorrectly-logging-and-recording-metrics-for-non-dapr-applications)
- [Incorrect error log on workflow scenario initialization](#incorrect-error-log-on-workflow-scenario-initialization)

## Fixed sidecar injector incorrectly logging and recording metrics for non-Dapr applications

### Problem

The Dapr sidecar injector was incorrectly logging "succeeded injection" and recording metrics for non-Dapr applications (pods without the `dapr.io/enabled: "true"` annotation). Although the injector correctly skipped injection for these pods, the false success logs and metrics made it difficult to monitor actual sidecar injection activity and distinguish between real injections and non-Dapr pod processing.

### Impact

Users inspecting sidecar injector logs and metrics saw misleading "successful injection" entries for applications that did not have Dapr enabled, making it difficult to monitor true injection success rates and debug injection issues.

### Root Cause

The injector treated "successfully processed the admission request" as "successfully injected the sidecar". When processing non-Dapr pods, `getPodPatchOperations()` correctly returned an empty patch with no error, but the code still logged success and recorded metrics even though no actual injection occurred.

### Solution

The injector now only logs success and records metrics when patch operations are generated (`len(patchOps) > 0`), ensuring we only report successful injections when an actual sidecar injection happens.

## Incorrect error log on workflow scenario initialization

### Problem

On initialization, daprd will print an error log stating "Error attempting to migrate reminders to scheduler: statestore reminders is not ready".

### Impact

The error log is misleading as it suggests a failure in migrating reminders, while in reality, it indicates that the state store is not yet ready during the initialization phase.
This can cause confusion for users monitoring logs.

### Root Cause

Programming error resulting in this log being printed at an inappropriate time during initialization.

### Solution

The error log no longer prints during successful initialization.
