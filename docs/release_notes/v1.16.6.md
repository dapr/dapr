## Fixed sidecar injector incorrectly logging and recording metrics for non-Dapr applications

### Problem

The Dapr sidecar injector was incorrectly logging "succeeded injection" and recording metrics for non-Dapr applications (pods without the `dapr.io/enabled: "true"` annotation). Although the injector correctly skipped injection for these pods, the false success logs and metrics made it difficult to monitor actual sidecar injection activity and distinguish between real injections and non-Dapr pod processing.

### Impact

Users inspecting sidecar injector logs and metrics saw misleading "successful injection" entries for applications that did not have Dapr enabled, making it difficult to monitor true injection success rates and debug injection issues.

### Root Cause

The injector treated "successfully processed the admission request" as "successfully injected the sidecar". When processing non-Dapr pods, `getPodPatchOperations()` correctly returned an empty patch with no error, but the code still logged success and recorded metrics even though no actual injection occurred.

### Solution

The injector now only logs success and records metrics when patch operations are generated (`len(patchOps) > 0`), ensuring we only report successful injections when an actual sidecar injection happens.
