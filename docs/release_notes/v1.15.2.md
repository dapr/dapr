## Fix Actor Invocation from non-Actor hosted Apps

### Problem

When invoking an actor from an app which did not have the Actor state store configured, the actor invocation fails.

### Impact

Applications were unable to invoke actors if the Actor state store was not scoped for that App ID.

### Root cause

If daprd did not have an Actor state store configured, it did not connect to Placement.
This meant it did not have the address for the target Actor.

### Solution

Daprd will always attempt to connect to Placement if a Placement address is configured.
