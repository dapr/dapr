- [Fix Scheduler memory leak](#fix-scheduler-memory-leak)

## Fix Actor Invocation from non-Actor hosted Apps

### Problem

When invoking an actor from an app which did not have the Actor state store configured, the actor invocation fails.

### Impact

Applications were unable to invoke actors if the Actor state store was not scoped for that App ID.

### Root cause

If daprd did not have an Actor state store configured, it did not connect to Placement.
This meant it did not have the address for the target Actor.

### Solution

Daprd will always attempt to connect to Placement if a Placement address is configured.

## Fix Scheduler memory leak

### Problem

Scheduler would continually grow in memory during usage.

### Impact

Scheduler would consume the entirety of memory on the host machine, or to it's cgroup limit, then OOM crash.

### Root cause

A Go routine was doing being closed on connection sends.

### Solution

Correctly close the Go routine on completion of the connection send.
