## Highlights
These are the v1.16 release highlights:

### Multi-application workflows

The Workflow API now supports multi-application workflows, enabling you to orchestrate complex business processes that span across multiple applications. This allows a workflow to call activities or start child workflows in different applications, distributing the workflow execution while maintaining the security, reliability, and durability guarantees of Dapr's workflow engine.

By using multi-app workflows, you can design distributed business processes, such as cross-application order processing, complex approval chains that involve multiple workflows and activites, and AI/ML pipelines that coordinate between LLM services and GPU-intensive workloads. Workflow durability and consistency is maintained across application boundaries, ensuring your distributed workflows remain resilient even when individual applications experience temporary failures.

Mutli-application workflows are supported in Java and Go SDKs as of this release. Learn more with the [multi-app workflows documentation](https://v1-16.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-multi-app/).

### Workflow performance

Dapr continues to invest into the Workflows API building block; with this release focusing on performance and stabilization, particularly when using Workflows for production at scale. These enhancements make Dapr Workflows more robust and performant for high-throughput workloads with high-concurrency requirements.

Key Improvements:

- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced memory allocations by pooling reused memory to reduce memory allocations and be smarter about object lifetimes to minimize garbage collection overhead.
- **Concurrency Enhancements**: Removed shared memory contention in both daprd and Scheduler to allow for higher throughput of workflow operations.
- **Scheduler Reliability**: Fixed deadlocks in the Scheduler service that could occur under extreme load conditions, ensuring more reliable job scheduling and execution.
- **Connection Management**: Improved and increased the number of cross-daprd and daprd-to-Scheduler streams to allow for more concurrent operations and reduce bottlenecks.

The results of these improvements mean that Dapr handles larger Workflow throughputs, consumes less memory & CPU overall, and the consumption of these resources is more stable.

The following table shows results of testing the performance of Workflows from Dapr v1.15 and v1.16.
-  Run on a 3 node EKS cluster, using t2.medium node sizes.
-  Actor state store is an Amazon RDS instance using db.r6g.2xlarge.
-  Go Workflow application which **starts all scheduled Workflows in parallel**, with each workflow executing **15 no-op activities sequentially**.

### HTTP Streaming / SSE support for HTTP Endpoints

You can now use Dapr to proxy requests to external HTTP servers that work with streaming or Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing Dapr to provide important functionality when communicating with MCP servers and AI agents like middleware authenticaton, resiliency policies, telemetry and distributed tracing.

[Learn more on HTTP streaming with service invocation](https://v1-16.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/howto-invoke-non-dapr-endpoints/#server-sent-events).

### Conversation API Tooling Support (alphaV2)

Dapr now supports tool calling in the Conversation API, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external functions and APIs during conversations. This feature allows applications to provide tools that LLMs can interact with to retrieve real-time data, perform calculations, or execute actions as part of the conversation flow. This makes conversations more interactive and dynamic, allowing LLMs to integrate with external services and data sources.

The new **AlphaV2** Conversation API introduces:
- **Function tools**: Define tools with JSON Schema parameters that LLMs can invoke
- **Tool choice control**: Configure tool usage with options such as `auto`, `none`, `required`, or a specific tool
- **Tool call messages**: Conversation history now supports assistant tool calls and tool responses
- **OpenAI Alignment**: API design follows OpenAI’s tool calling patterns for a familiar developer experience
  [The API was updated to Alpha2](https://v1-16.docs.dapr.io/reference/api/conversation_api/)
  Applications using the previous **AlphaV1** API can migrate to **AlphaV2** to access tool calling and benefit from the improved, OpenAI-aligned interface.

Try tool calling with [Conversation API quickstarts](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/release-1.16/conversation)


### Sentry Service JWT and OIDC Support

The Sentry service was extended to include advanced authentication capabilities with JWT and OIDC support, enabling integration with external identity providers through workload identity federation.

You can configure Sentry to issue JWT tokens and expose OIDC discovery endpoints (`/.well-known/openid-configuration` and `/jwks.json`). These tokens can, for example, be exchanged with Microsoft Entra ID for Azure access tokens by creating a Federated Identity Credential tied to your Dapr app’s SPIFFE ID.

- **Federated Identity Credential integration**: Authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID using SPIFFE IDs, no need for long-lived secrets.
- **JWT and OIDC in Sentry**: Enable JWT issuance and OIDC discovery endpoints in Sentry.
- **Consistent identity across environments**: Same authentication model regardless of where your Dapr app is running.

See the [Managed identities and workload identity federation](https://v1-16.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/integrations/azure/azure-authentication/authenticating-azure/) and [Authenticating with a Federated Identity Credential in Azure](https://v1-16.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/integrations/azure/azure-authentication/authenticating-azure/) for a walkthrough.

### W3C Baggage Support for Distributed Tracing

Dapr now supports W3C Baggage propagation alongside trace context, enabling you to pass custom key-value pairs across your distributed services. This allows you to attach contextual information like user IDs, server nodes, or business-specific tags that travel with your traces throughout the entire request flow.

This feature supports 2 propagation methods:

- OpenTelemetry context baggage
- Header/Metadata baggage

Dapr automatically handles the propagation and encoding requirements, ensuring your baggage data reaches downstream services while maintaining security boundaries between different propagation domains. This makes it easier to correlate business context with technical traces, improving debugging, and observability across your microservices architecture.

Learn more on [how to configure and use baggage](https://v1-16.docs.dapr.io/operations/observability/tracing/w3c-tracing-overview/#w3c-trace-context-and-headers-format).

## Upgrading to Dapr 1.16

To upgrade to this release of Dapr, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade. You know, the one where you don't get red errors on the terminal.. we all hate that, right?

### Local Machine / Self-hosted

Uninstall Dapr using the CLI you currently have installed. Note that this will remove the default $HOME/.dapr directory, binaries and all containers dapr_redis, dapr_placement and dapr_zipkin. Linux users need to run sudo if docker command needs sudo:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

For RC releases like this, download the latest and greatest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

Once you have installed the CLI, run:

```bash
dapr init --runtime-version=1.16
```

Wait for the update to finish,  ensure you are using the latest version of Dapr(1.16) with:

```bash
$ dapr --version

CLI version: 1.16
Runtime version: 1.16
```

### Kubernetes

#### Upgrading from previous version

You can perform zero-downtime upgrades using both Helm 3 and the Dapr CLI.

##### Upgrade using the CLI

Download the latest RC release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

To upgrade Dapr, run:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.16 -k
```

To upgrade with high availability mode:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.16 --enable-ha=true -k
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

##### Upgrade using Helm

To upgrade Dapr using Helm, run:

```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

helm upgrade dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.16 --namespace=dapr-system --wait
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

#### Starting a fresh install on a cluster

Please see [how to deploy Dapr on a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/) for a complete guide to installing Dapr on Kubernetes

You can use Helm 3 to install Dapr:
```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

kubectl create namespace dapr-system

helm install dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.16 --namespace dapr-system --wait
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest version of CLI:

```
dapr init --runtime-version=1.16 -k
```

##### Post installation

Verify the control plane pods are running and are healthy:

```
$ dapr status -k
  NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.16   15s  2025-08-27 13:07.39
  dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.16   15s  2025-08-27 13:07.39
  dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.16   15s  2025-08-27 13:07.39
  dapr-placement         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.16   15s  2025-08-27 13:07.39
  dapr-scheduler         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.16   15s  2025-08-27 13:07.39
```

After Dapr 1.16 has been installed, perform a rolling restart for your deployments to pick up the new version of the sidecar.
This can be done with:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<deployment-name>
```
