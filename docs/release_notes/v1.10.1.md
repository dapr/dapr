# Dapr 1.10.1

## Fixes regression in Cloud Event fields "id" and "source"

### Problem

Dapr 1.10.0 introduced a regression in pub/sub. When publishing a message, Dapr incorrectly sets the Dapr "app-id" as the `id` field in the Cloud Envelope instead of a UUID value, Additionally, the `source` field was be set to `"Dapr"`, irrespective of the app-id producing the event.

### Impact

This impacts Dapr users who publish messages and who are not using custom cloud events and/or raw paylods.

Impacted Dapr version is 1.10.0.

### Root cause

The regression was introduced in a code change first merged for Dapr 1.10.0.

### Solution

We adjusted the change and added tests to capture the correctness of the `id` field for the scenario where Dapr is required to produce a new cloud event.
