# Dapr 0.2.0
 
We're happy to announce the release of Dapr 0.2.0.
 
This release focuses on community-driven components (BIG thank you to everyone involved, you rock), bug fixes across the Dapr runtime and CLI, updates to documentation and samples and the addition of E2E tests.

Visit the [getting started](https://github.com/dapr/docs/tree/master/getting-started) page to get started with Dapr.

## Upgrading to Dapr 0.2.0

To get the latest bits, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli#installing-dapr-cli) to download the latest and greatest CLI release and binaries.

Once you have the Dapr CLI in your path, run `dapr init`.
Wait for the update to finish, and you're good to go!

## Kubernetes

If you previously installed Dapr on your Kubernetes cluster using the Dapr CLI, first download the latest CLI release as outlined above.

Once you have the CLI, run:

```
dapr uninstall --kubernetes
dapr init --kubernetes
```

If installed Dapr previously via Helm, run the following command to upgrade:

```
helm upgrade dapr dapr/dapr --set global.tag=0.2.0
```

*Note: If you installed with a different chart name, use `helm upgrade <your-chart-name>`*
