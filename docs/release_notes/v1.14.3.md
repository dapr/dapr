## Fix AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store components when working with more granular IAM permissions

### Problem

When using AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store daprd would fail on initialisation if the IAM policy would only allow access for certain secrets.

### Impact

Dapr wouldn't be able to start if the IAM policy would only allow access to certain secrets.

### Root cause

On initialisation daprd would try to verify access to the AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store services by trying to read a dummy secret which would fail if the IAM policy in place would only allow access to certain secrets.

### Solution

The additional check was removed.
