# Dapr 1.14.3

⚠️ When upgrading from Dapr versions `v1.14.0`, `v1.14.1`, or `v1.14.2` to `v1.14.3`, the upgrade fails with the following error:

```
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "dapr-scheduler-server" with kind StatefulSet: StatefulSet.apps "dapr-scheduler-server" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: updates to statefulset spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'ordinals', 'template', 'updateStrategy', 'persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy' and 'minReadySeconds' are forbidden
```

The workaround for the user is to Delete the Scheduler StatefulSet before re-running the upgrade with the new storage size, but we recommend skipping this version and upgrading to `v1.14.4` instead.

## Fix AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store components when working with more granular IAM permissions

### Problem

When using AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store daprd would fail on initialisation if the IAM policy would only allow access for certain secrets.

### Impact

Dapr wouldn't be able to start if the IAM policy would only allow access to certain secrets.

### Root cause

On initialisation daprd would try to verify access to the AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store services by trying to read a dummy secret which would fail if the IAM policy in place would only allow access to certain secrets.

### Solution

The additional check was removed.

## Fix Scheduler embedded ETCD database running out of memory

### Problem

Creating a reasonable number of Jobs or Actor Reminders (also through workflows) with the Scheduler, would case the embedded Scheduler to run out of memory.

### Impact

The Jobs, Actor Reminders, and Workflow APIs would become unavailable.

### Root cause

The default storage size of the embedded ETCD database was too small, as well as the purging of deleted data was not sufficiently aggressive enough.

### Solution

Increase the default storage size of the embedded ETCD database from 2Gi to 16Gi, increase the frequency of purging of deleted data.
More options are now exposed on the Scheduler to tune these values further.



## Fix the Job HTTP Trigger Request body base64 encoding values

### Problem

When handling a Job trigger in a HTTP application, the value content of the request body could be base64 encoded, causing application serialization errors.

### Impact

The Job trigger would not be processed by the application correctly.

### Root cause

The Job trigger was erroneously encoding the request body value content when sending the request to the applicaiton.

### Solution

daprd now sends the request body value content as a standard JSON string.

## Change the HTTP Job API request body data field to accept JSON strings

### Problem

The HTTP Job API request body data field previously accepted fully qualified protobuf messages.

### Impact

The HTTP API was less approachable for users who wanted to test and develop with the HTTP API, often times using curl or Postman etc.

### Root cause

The HTTP Job API used the same request schema as the gRPC API.

### Solution

The HTTP Job API now accepts JSON strings for the request body data field.

## Add securityContext/runAsGroup and securityContext/runAsUser as sidecar injector options

### Problem

daprd sidecar is missing the `securityContext/runAsGroup` and/or `securityContext/runAsUser` settings.

### Impact

daprd sidecar was not passing security checks by some policy enforcement solutions and could not run.

### Root cause

Missing the ability to set the `securityContext/runAsGroup` and/or `securityContext/runAsUser` settings.

### Solution

Added the `dapr_sidecar_injector.sidecarRunAsUser` and/or `dapr_sidecar_injector.sidecarRunAsGroup` helm chart settings.
