# Dapr 1.6.2

## Summary

This hotfix release addresses a change made in how Actor Timers are validated during creation. Specifically, `DueTime` can be set to 0 to have a reminder fire immediately.

### Runtime
* An Actor Timer with a `DueTime` of `0` will now pass validation allowing timers to fire immediately.

## Details

### Actor Timer Creation

#### Problem

Registering an Actor Timer with a `DueTime` of `0` would fail and the Timer would not be started.

#### Root cause

A change introduced in release 1.6 caused Timers to be invalidated if their `DueTime` was in the past. However, when the `DueTime` is 0, signifying an immediate fire, it is set in Dapr to the current time. After it was set to the current time, it would later be compared to the current time again. As these time comparisons did not share the value for current time, it is almost guaranteed that the `DueTime` would now appear to be in the past.

#### Solution

Revert the code to pre-1.6 behavior which allows `DueTimes` to be in the past as that still equates to firing immediately.
