## Upgrading to Dapr 0.11.0

To upgrade to this release of Dapr, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade. You know, the one where you don't get red errors on the terminal.. we all hate that, right?

### Local Machine / Self-hosted

Uninstall Dapr using the CLI you currently have installed. Note that this will remove the default $HOME/.dapr directory, binaries and all containers dapr_redis, dapr_placement and dapr_zipkin. Linux users need to run sudo if they have installed binary in default path /usr/local/bin/ or have docker command needing sudo:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

Next, follow [these](https://github.com/dapr/cli#installing-dapr-cli) instructions to install the latest CLI version, or alternatively download the latest and greatest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

Once you have installed the CLI, run:

```bash
dapr init
```

Wait for the update to finish,  ensure you are using the latest version of Dapr(0.11.0) with:

```bash
$ dapr --version

CLI version: 0.11.0
Runtime version: 0.11.0
```

### Kubernetes

#### Upgrading from 0.10.0

If you previously installed Dapr using Helm, starting with this releases you can now upgrade Dapr to a new version.
If you installed Dapr using the CLI, go [here](#starting-fresh).

##### 1. Get the latest CLI

Get the latest version of the Dapr CLI as outlined above, and put it in your path.
You can also use the helper scripts outlined [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli#installing-dapr-cli) to get the latest version.

##### 2. Upgrade existing cluster

First, update your Helm repos:

```
helm repo update
```

Run the following commands to upgrade the Dapr control plan system services:

* Remove ClusterRole Binding (**Needed** for upgrading to v0.11.0. This is for this release only.)
  ```
  kubectl delete clusterrolebinding dapr-operator
  ```

* Export certificates

  ```
  dapr mtls export -o ./certs
  ```

* Updating Dapr control plane pods
  * Usings the certs exported above, run the following command:
    ```
    helm upgrade dapr dapr/dapr --version 0.11.0 --namespace dapr-system --reset-values --set-file dapr_sentry.tls.root.certPEM=./certs/ca.crt --set-file dapr_sentry.tls.issuer.certPEM=./certs/issuer.crt --set-file dapr_sentry.tls.issuer.keyPEM=./certs/issuer.key
    ```

  * Wait until all the pods are in Running state:

    ```
    kubectl get pods -w -n dapr-system
    ```

  * Verify the control plane is updated and healthy:

    ```
    $ dapr status -k

    NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
    dapr-dashboard         dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.3.0    15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
    dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.11.0   15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
    dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.11.0   15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
    dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.11.0   15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
    dapr-placement         dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.11.0   15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
    ```

* Updating the data plane (sidecars)
  * Next, issue a rolling update to your Dapr enabled deployments. When the pods restart, the new Dapr sidecar version will be picked up.

    ```
    kubectl rollout restart deploy/<DEPLOYMENT-NAME>
    ```

All done!

#### Starting fresh install on a cluster 

If you previously installed Dapr on your Kubernetes cluster using the Dapr CLI, run:

*Note: Make sure you're uninstalling with your existing CLI version*

```bash
dapr uninstall --kubernetes
```

It's fine to ignore any errors that might show up.

If you previously installed Dapr using __Helm 2.X__:

```bash
helm del --purge dapr
```

If you previously installed Dapr using __Helm 3.X__:

```bash
helm uninstall dapr -n dapr-system
```

Update the Dapr repo:

```bash
helm repo update
```

If you installed Dapr with Helm to a namespace other than `dapr-system`, modify the uninstall command above to account for that.

You can now follow [these](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/getting-started/environment-setup.md#using-helm-advanced) instructions on how to install Dapr using __Helm 3__.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI:

```
dapr init --kubernetes
```

#### Post installation

Verify the control plane pods are running and are healthy:

```
$ dapr status -k

  NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-dashboard         dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.3.0    15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
  dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.11.0   15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
  dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.11.0   15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
  dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.11.0   15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
  dapr-placement         dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.11.0   15s  2020-09-28 13:07.39
```

After Dapr 0.11.0 has been installed, perform a rolling restart for your deployments to pick up the new version of the sidecar.
This can be done with:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<deployment-name>
```

## Breaking Changes

### Dapr Runtime

#### Serialization changes for gRPC State Transaction APIs

A double serialization issue when gRPC State Transaction API was used, has been fixed in this release. As a result, states previously saved via the gRPC State Transaction API, will not be properly deserialized with the latest v0.11.0 version of the code. 

For example previously, a string saved using the gRPC State Transaction API was saved as: 

```
\"saved state\"
```

When deserialized, it would be read as `"saved state"` instead of `saved state`. Similarly for JSON serialized values, it was marshaled once again and then saved.

This has been fixed in v0.11.0 and the double serialization removed. Any code that expects the value in the previous incorrectly serialized format will need some changes to work with v0.11.0.

Read more [here](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/2016).

### Components Contrib 

#### Implementation of NATS pub/sub component changed

The implementation of NATS pub/sub component changed from NATS serving to NATS streaming. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/howto/setup-pub-sub-message-broker/setup-nats-streaming.md) for NATS streaming setup and usage.

### Java SDK 

#### Tracing support 

The Java SDK supports sending and receiving trace context with the API calls. All APIs have a complex Request object with builder
with the method 

```java
withContext(io.grpc.Context context)
```

to pass trace context to Dapr. 

Similarly the responses from Dapr APIs are now wrapped in a [Response](https://github.com/dapr/java-sdk/blob/master/sdk/src/main/java/io/dapr/client/domain/Response.java) object which contains the actual response and the context associated with it.

Old method signature: 

```java
Mono<Void> publishEvent(PublishEventRequest request);
```

New method signature: 

```java
Mono<Response<Void>> publishEvent(PublishEventRequest request);
```
