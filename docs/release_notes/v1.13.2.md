# Dapr 1.13.2

This update includes bug fixes:

- [Fix incorrect content-length being sent to HTTP published message](#fix-incorrect-content-length-being-sent-to-http-published-message)
- [Fix PubSub in-flight messages from being cancelled during blocked shutdown](#fix-pubsub-in-flight-messages-from-being-cancelled-during-blocked-shutdown)

## Fix incorrect content-length being sent to HTTP published message

### Problem

Published messages to HTTP application server report a content-length error and are not processed.

### Impact

PubSub messages from some PubSubs cannot be processed by the application.

### Root cause

The content-length reported by the PubSub broker message was copied to the message sent to the application's HTTP server.
This content-length may not match the final message length sent to the application's HTTP server, resulting in the mesage being rejected.

### Solution

Filter out the content-length header from the PubSub broker message before sending it to the application's HTTP server.

## Fix PubSub in-flight messages from being cancelled during blocked shutdown.

### Problem

During a blocked shutdown, all in-flight PubSub messages are cancelled and cannot be processed by the application or the applications processes status discarded.

### Impact

During shutdown, in-flight messages which are currently being processed by the application cannot be completed.

### Root cause

During shutdown, all publish calls to the application where being cancelled.

### Solution

PubSub messages are now published to the application in an isolated routine, which is not cancelled during blocked shutdown.

## Fix null value handling in AVRO schema validation for Kafka pub/sub.

### Problem

When using Avro schema validation with the Kafka pub/sub component, consuming messages with a null value will fail and not be delivered to the app, and publishing messages with null values will fail.

### Impact

Kafka messages with null values for both consumers and publishers are not delivered or published when using the Avro schema validation feature.

### Root cause

The Dapr component did not have correct handling of null values in a message.

### Solution

Handling of null values was added when serializing and deserializing messages.
