## Fixes gRPC proxying not working when API allowlists are configured

### Problem

A regression introduced in Dapr 1.10.0 caused gRPC proxying to not work when [API allowlists](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/configuration/api-allowlist/) are used. All calls to proxied gRPC endpoints would fail with an "Unimplemented" gRPC error.

### Impact

The issue impacts users on Dapr 1.10.0-1.10.3 that use API allowlists for gRPC APIs, and who use gRPC proxying.

### Root cause

A regression was introduced in Dapr 1.10.0 that caused all proxied gRPC requests to be matched against the API allowlist when that is configured for gRPC, with the consequence that all calls were rejected.

### Solution

We have changed how API allowlists work for gRPC, so all proxied calls are always allowed regardless of the rules in the allowlists. We have added tests to prevent future regressions.
