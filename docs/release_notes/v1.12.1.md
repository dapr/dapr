# Dapr 1.12.1

Update includes a fix for the Sentry authentication validator rejecting valid
requests.

## Fixed Sentry rejecting valid requests from Daprd

### Problem

Daprds would fail to request an identity certificate from Sentry when residing in a Namespace or using a Service Account with a sufficiently long name.

### Impact

Daprds would fail to start, causing that application from joining the Dapr cluster.
Effects only the Dapr versio `v1.12.0`.

### Root cause

Sentry validates that clients cannot request for an app ID which is over 64 characters in length.
Sentry also still accepts requests which use the legacy identifier of `<namespace>:<service account>` which was not taken account for when doing the 64 character evaluation.

### Solution

Sentry now evaluates the actual app ID being requested, whether or not the client is using the legacy or app ID as the identifier.
