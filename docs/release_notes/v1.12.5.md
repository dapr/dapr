## Azure Event Hubs bindings and pubsub silently fail to recover subscriptions during event processor failures

### Problem

The Azure Event Hubs bindings and pubsub components may fail in such a way that for one or multiple subscribed topics no further events will be received.

### Impact

Impacts users running Dapr 1.12.4 or earlier that use Azure EventHubs bindings or pubsub components. The dapr sidecar error message `Error from event processor` indicates that this problem has been encountered.

### Root cause

Under certain failure scenarios (including networking interruption) the Event Hubs event processor for a particular subscription topic can return an error. When this occurs the error is logged once, existing partition clients will terminate with errors and no further partition clients will be allocated. At this point the subscription for this topic effectively ends with no attempt to restart the subscription. This however does not impact other sidecar functionality and the sidecar continues to report healthy status.

### Solution

Added error handling for the topic event processor host to restart the entire subscription loop for this topic 5 seconds after an error is encountered.
