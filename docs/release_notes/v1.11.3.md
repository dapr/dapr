## Fixed Dapr Operator CrashLoopBackOff when Argo Controller is enabled

### Problem

When using the Dapr Operator on Kubernetes with Argo Controller enabled, the operator would fail to start with the following error:

```
time="2023-07-11T17:22:49.937549597Z" level=fatal msg="error running operator: error running operator: failed to wait for rollout caches to sync: timed out waiting for cache to be synced" instance=dapr-operator-7cd6d96dfd-9wbj7 scop │ │ Stream closed EOF for dapr-system/dapr-operator-7cd6d96dfd-9wbj7 (dapr-operator)
```

### Impact

The Dapr Operator would fail to start when Argo Controller is enabled and a Argo rollout is performend.

### Root cause

The Dapr Operator was not creating the full Operator scheme before waiting for the controller manager to start.

### Solution

Updated the Dapr Operator to create the full Operator scheme before waiting for the controller manager to start.
