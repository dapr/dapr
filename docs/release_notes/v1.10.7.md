## Fixed an issue in Kafka components with SASL authentication

### Problem

When attempting to connect to Kafka compatible services like Azure Event Hubs using SALS authentication the connection fails with the message "client has run out of available brokers to talk to."

### Impact

The issue impacts users on Dapr 1.10.x who use Kafka components to connect to Azure Event Hubs. Other Kafka compatible services may be impacted too.

### Root cause

The latest versions (1.38.X) of the shopify/sarama kafka library introduced this problem.

### Solution

Downgrading the shopify/sarama library to release 1.37.2 resolves this problem. An issue with the maintainers of the sarama library has been created for further investigation.
