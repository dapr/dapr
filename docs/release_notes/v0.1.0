# June 2019 (0.1.0)

This release of Actions focuses mainly on the engineering system capabilities of the Actions Runtime and the Actions CLI.
Several bug fixes and new Actor capabilities were introduced.

* Added makes files
* Established Azure Devops CI/CD pipelines
* Allow ```/action/<id>/<method>``` to invoke a local app
* Added versioning to the Runtime, CLI and the Assigner
* Added architecture diagrams
* Controller configuration to externalize runtime docker image

This release is available now - see [how to update](/docs/supporting/howtoupdate.md) to get the bits.

Read on to find out about the new features and learn how you can be more productive using VS Code.

## Make Files

With the addition of the Makefile, you can now perform the following:

#### Run tests tests

```
make tests 
```

#### Build

Build all to all platforms:

```
make build
```

Build for a specific platform:

```
make build TARGETS=linux
```

#### Pull dependencies

This will install Dep if it doesn't exist on the local environment.

```
make deps
```

## CI/CD pipelines

We setup an Azure Devops Pipelines in order to execute parallel build agents and run tests across Linux, MacOS and Windows.
The pipelines run the makes files and then build and push the Docker images to our Docker registry.

The binaries are getting zipped and uploaded to: ```https://actionsreleases.blob.core.windows.net/bin```

## Local service discovery

Fixed a bug where calling an Action ID running on the same machine as the caller would not work.

## Runtime and CLI versioning

The release versions are now getting baked inside the Go code when using the Make files. Otherwise, the version is ```edge```.

## Architecture diagrams

Added two diagrams depicting Actions in a Kubernetes environmnet and Actions in a standalone non-containerized environment.

## External controller configuration

The image of the Actions Runtine injected by the Kubernetes operator was until now hardcoded.
An environment variable named ```RUNTIME_IMAGE``` for the operator container now sets the Docker image used for the sidecar container.
