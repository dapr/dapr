# Dapr 1.10.2

## Fix removing extra commits from master branch in 1.10.1

### Problem

This release does not address any known issue. The Dapr 1.10.1 hotfix contained additional commits from the `master` branch that were not part of the 1.10 release branch.
The 1.10.2 hotfix guarantees that all changes in the release are tested and validated.

### Impact

There is no known impact to users.

### Root cause

The v1.10.1 tag pulled in additional commits from the `master` branch, possibly due to being based off of `master` branch.

### Solution

Tagging a minor version release off of the `release-1.10` branch.
