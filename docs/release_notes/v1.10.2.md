# Dapr 1.10.2

## Fix removing extra commits from master branch in 1.10.1

### Problem

This release does not address any known issue. The Dapr 1.10.1 hotfix contained additional commits from the `master` branch that were not part of the 1.10 release branch.
The 1.10.2 hotfix guarantees that all changes in the release are tested and validated.

### Impact

There are no known issues or regressions. The impact is having additional code changes in the 1.10.1 version that did not go through proper release tests.

### Root cause

The v1.10.1 tag pulled in additional code changes from the `master` branch, that were not scheduled to be included in the 1.10.x release.

### Solution

We are releasing Dapr v1.10.2 with the correct set of changes from the Dapr 1.10 branch. Dapr 1.10.1 artifacts will be deleted.
