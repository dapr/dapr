# Dapr 1.1.1

## Fixes

* Add POST HTTP API for shutdown (https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/3020)

### Overview

If you are not using the HTTP shutdown API as part of the Kubernetes job support that was added in v1.1, you do not need to upgrade to 1.1.1. If you are using this feature, please read on.

As a general rule, state mutating APIs should not be GET requests. The newly added shutdown API endpoint allows changing the state of the Dapr sidecar, by asking it to quit. We are adding a POST API that is functionally equivalent to the GET API. The GET API will be deprecated according to our [deprecation plan](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-release-policy/#feature-and-deprecations). We strongly recommend that anyone looking to adopt Kubernetes job support via the HTTP shutdown API integrate with the POST API.

Please see the [latest documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-job/) for an example integration with the HTTP POST shutdown API.
