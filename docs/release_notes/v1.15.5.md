- [Fix Workflow execution deadlock](#fix-workflow-execution-deadlock)

## Fix Workflow execution deadlock

### Problem

After running a number of workflows for a long enough time, execution would become stuck.

### Impact

Workflows could no longer be executed.

### Root cause

The implementation of the Workflow queue in Scheduler (diagridio/go-etcd-cron) would occur a deadlock in very rare circumstances.

### Solution

The go-etcd-cron queue implementation has been updated to use a control loop paradigm to avoid deadlocks.
A side effect of this change will see Workflow (and Job generally) see a ~3x improvement in performance in high throughput scenarios.
