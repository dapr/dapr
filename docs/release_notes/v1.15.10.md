- [Sidecar Panic when calling endpoints with redirect behavior](#sidecar-panic-when-calling-endpoints-with-redirect-behavior)

## Sidecar Panic when calling endpoints with redirect behavior

### Problem

The Dapr sidecar would crash (panic) when invoking a non-Dapr HTTP endpoint that returned a redirect response.

### Impact

This bug caused the Dapr sidecar to become unstable and fail unexpectedly when interacting with external services that use HTTP redirects.

### Root cause

The panic was caused by a nil pointer dereference in the HTTP metrics middleware, which occurred when an uninitialized response writer was accessed during a redirect.

### Solution

The `pathMatchingRW` struct was updated to correctly handle redirects and always provide a valid `http.Header` map, which prevents the nil pointer dereference.
