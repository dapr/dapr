# Dapr 0.3.0

We're happy to announce the release of Dapr 0.3.0.

This release focused on improvements to our [end-to-end tests infrastructure](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/tree/master/tests), making Service Discovery into pluggable components to support more hosting platforms, adding a few new components, improving CLI error messages and stability, and resolving bugs on and improving the Dotnet SDK.

Visit the [getting started](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr/) page to get started with Dapr.

## Upgrading to Dapr 0.3.0

To get the latest bits, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr/) to download the latest and greatest CLI release and binaries.

## Standalone

Once you have the Dapr CLI in your path:

Wait for the update to finish, and you're good to go!
