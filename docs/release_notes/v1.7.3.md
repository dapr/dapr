### Fixes incorrect actor state-store configuration behavior

#### Problem

Omitting a state store configuration will cause the actor subsystem to fail to initialize. This is the correct behavior for services providing actors but this not for services acting as consumers / clients of actors that other services provide. A service acting purely as a consumer does not need state storage and should initiazlize correctly in order to invoke actors elsewhere. 

#### Root cause

Absence of a state store causes the actor subsystem to throw an error, regardless of whether or not the service is providing hosted actors.

#### Solution

Thix fix changes the actor runtime initialization logic such that, when there is no state store available, the actor subsystem will successfully initialize for consumers but will fail for services with hosted actors.
