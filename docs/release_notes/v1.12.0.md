## Highlights

These are the v1.12 release highlights:

## APIs

### Service Invocation: HTTP streaming stable and enabled by default

The HTTP service invocation API now leverages streaming by default and is stable in the v1.12 release. This increases the overall performance of HTTP service invocation in many scenarios. Users that leverage HTTP service invocation will notice improvements such as: reduced memory usage, much smaller time-to-first-byte (TTFB), and can now send messages in chunks.

### Service Invocation: TLS for non-Dapr endpoints

You can now securely call `https://` non-Dapr endpoints providing a [certificate for authentication to the remote endpoint](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/howto-invoke-non-dapr-endpoints/#tls-authentication)

### State Management: Outbox Pattern for state stores (preview feature)

The [outbox pattern](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/howto-outbox/) enables a single transaction across a state store and any message broker and is a powerful design pattern for sending notifications regarding changes in an applicationâ€™s state.

In this v1.12 release, the outbox pattern is enabled as a preview feature for any transactional state store.

### Dapr Workflow in beta, with Java support

The workflow runtime and APIs have been moved to [beta status](https://github.com/dapr/proposals/blob/7138b9c2835b91dfc3a16570b59882430a7940c8/guides/api-design.md#api-lifecycle-expectations) indicating the next stage of maturity towards stable. The [beta APIs](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/operations/support/alpha-beta-apis/#beta-apis) are the preferred choice when calling the Workflow APIs directly. [Note: the alpha APIs remain functional to prevent breaking changes]

Additionally, [Java SDK](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/#workflow-sdks) is now supported for authoring Workflows, which you can try through the [Java workflow quickstarts](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/#try-out-workflows).

### Metadata API improvements

The [metadata API](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/api/metadata_api/) on the [Dapr sidecar](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/concepts/dapr-services/sidecar/) now includes information on the [app connection details](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/api/metadata_api/#app-connection-details) including the app port, protocol, host, max concurrency, along with health check details as seen from the Dapr sidecar.

### Improvement to Dapr actors and Placement APIs

In this v1.12 release we continued to make improvements to Dapr actors, including bug fixes and performance improvements to Actor Reminders.

Some notable changes include:

- A new [placement API](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/api/placement_api/) on the [Placement service](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/concepts/dapr-services/placement/#placement-tables) enables you to examine the placement tables to determine which types of actors are deployed and where they are active. This gives you more insight to actors at runtime and aids in debugging actor issues.
- API calls to Actor (and Workflow) endpoints now block while the Dapr actor runtime is being initialized, so applications don't need to guess anymore when the actor runtime is ready after Dapr has started.
- We have made improvements to the performance of Actor Reminders, reducing reducing the need to perform multiple re-evaluations when more than one Dapr sidecar goes online and/or offline at the same time, and better handling locking to prevent race conditions.
- We have fixed a bug that could cause an actor to be activated on two apps at the same time if a reminder is being executed during a rebalancing.

## CLI

- To make **setting up a development environment on Kubernetes easier**, the [`dapr init -k` command](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-init/) now supports a `--dev` option which deploy Redis and Zipkin containers to Kubernetes identical to the self-hosted mode. Simply set the Kubernetes cluster configuration context! Give this is try on your locally kubernetes cluster!
- You can now **pass [multiple resource paths](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/cli/dapr-run/) when running applications**. For example `dapr run --app-id myapp --resources-path path1 --resources-path path2` . For example you can have a shared folder for components used across many application and a per application specific folder. This applies to any of the [Dapr resources](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/resource-specs/).

### Multi App run

- [Multi-App run](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/local-development/multi-app-dapr-run/multi-app-overview/) enables you to run several applications locally to test them together. Windows is now supported along with Linux and Mac.
- [Multi-App run for Kubernetes](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/local-development/multi-app-dapr-run/multi-app-overview/) now makes it easy to launch and run multiple apps with container images at the same time on Kubernetes. Try this out with the [hello kubernetes tutorial](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/master/tutorials/hello-kubernetes) which saves having to launch multiple command windows to test multiple apps together.

## Components

- All bindings now support an optional [bindings direction](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/api/bindings_api/#binding-direction-optional) either input vs output. Using a binding direction means that Dapr does not need to query the application for binding information. See [binding quickstart](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/master/bindings/components) for some examples.
- State store API now [returns TTL](https://v1-b12.docs.dapr.io/reference/api/state_api/) as part of the response metadata, allowing applications to make caching decisions based on the remaining time. [2987](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/pull/2987)

### New components

There are over 115+ components in Dapr. One more component has been added in this release:

- [Azure OpenAI binding](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/openai/)

### Pluggable components: Secret stores now supported

- Secret stores are now supported as a [pluggable component type](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/develop-components/pluggable-components/pluggable-components-overview/) (preview feature). You can try out a [secret store.NET sample](https://github.com/dapr/samples/tree/master/pluggable-components-dotnet-template) and read more about [secret store pluggable components](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/develop-components/pluggable-components/develop-pluggable/). Note that as of this release v1.12 runtime release, the .NET and Go SDKs need to be updated to support pluggable secret stores. This will occur in the v1.13 milestone.

### Component stabilization

The following components have been promoted to stable status:

- Pub/sub: [Azure Service Bus Queues](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/setup-azure-servicebus-queues/)
- Binding: [Zeebe command](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/zeebe-command/)
- Binding: [Zeebe jobworker](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/zeebe-jobworker/)
- [In-memory pub/sub](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/setup-inmemory/) and [In-memory state store](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-inmemory/) components

### Component improvements

  - Support for [wasi-http in the Wasm binding](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-middleware/middleware-wasm/)
- **State stores**:
  - All transactional state stores now return the TTL when retrieving metadata.
  - [etcd state store](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-state-stores/setup-etcd/) now at v2
- **Pub/sub**:
  - [RabbitMQ can now be configured to create quorum queues](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/setup-rabbitmq/#use-quorum-queues). In addition the queue name can be set via subscription metadata.
- **Name resolvers**:
  - [You can now provide configuration](https://v1-12.docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-name-resolution/nr-kubernetes/#configuration-format) for the DNS name resolution for Kubernetes
- **PostgreSQL components**:
  - All PostgreSQL components (binding, configuration store, state store) now support authentication with AzureÂ AD
- **WASM components**:
  - WASM components now support "strict mode", which offers additional protection against side-channel attacks when running untrusted code

## [v1.11 Preview Features](https://v1-11.docs.dapr.io/operations/support/support-preview-features/) now stable

- The HTTP service invocation API now leverages streaming by default. This increases the overall performance of HTTP service invocation in many scenarios.

## Upgrading to Dapr 1.12

To upgrade to this release of Dapr, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade. You know, the one where you don't get red errors on the terminalâ€¦ _we all hate that, right?_

### Local Machine / Self-hosted

Uninstall Dapr using the CLI you currently have installed. Note that this will remove the default $HOME/.dapr directory, binaries and all containers dapr_redis, dapr_placement and dapr_zipkin. Linux users need to run sudo if docker command needs sudo:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

For RC releases like this, download the latest and greatest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

Once you have installed the CLI, run:

```bash
dapr init --runtime-version=1.12
```

Wait for the update to finish,  ensure you are using the latest version of Dapr(1.12) with:

```bash
$ dapr --version

CLI version: 1.12
Runtime version: 1.12
```

### Kubernetes

#### Upgrading from previous version

You can perform zero-downtime upgrades using both Helm 3 and the Dapr CLI.

##### Upgrade using the CLI

Download the latest RC release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

To upgrade Dapr, run:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.12 -k
```

To upgrade with high availability mode:

```
dapr upgrade --runtime-version 1.12 --enable-ha=true -k
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

##### Upgrade using Helm

To upgrade Dapr using Helm, run:

```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

helm upgrade dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.12 --namespace=dapr-system --wait
```

Wait until the operation is finished and check your status with `dapr status -k`.

All done!

*Note: Make sure your deployments are restarted to pick the latest version of the Dapr sidecar*

#### Starting a fresh install on a cluster

Please see [how to deploy Dapr on a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/hosting/kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy/) for a complete guide to installing Dapr on Kubernetes

You can use Helm 3 to install Dapr:
```
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update

kubectl create namespace dapr-system

helm install dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.12 --namespace dapr-system --wait
```

Alternatively, you can use the latest version of CLI:

```
dapr init --runtime-version=1.12 -k
```

##### Post installation

Verify the control plane pods are running and are healthy:

```
$ dapr status -k
  NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.12   15s  2023-09-26 13:07.39
  dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.12   15s  2023-09-26 13:07.39
  dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.12   15s  2023-09-26 13:07.39
  dapr-placement         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.12   15s  2023-09-26 13:07.39
```

After Dapr 1.12 has been installed, perform a rolling restart for your deployments to pick up the new version of the sidecar.
This can be done with:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<deployment-name>
```

## Breaking Changes

- Disallow operations on reminders for actor types that are not currently being hosted [dapr#6493](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/6493)
- The **HTTP Binding** now has a default `maxResponseBodySize` of 100 MB, for security reasons [components-contrib#3040](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/pull/3040)
- Azure App Config: fix time format to time.duration [components-contrib#3004](https://github.com/dapr/components-contrib/pull/3004)

## Deprecation Notices

- The **NATS Streaming** PubSub component has been deprecated in Dapr 1.12 and will be removed in Dapr 1.13. The upstream NATS Streaming project has been deprecated and has reached End-Of-Life in June 2023. The upstream projects recommends all users [migrate to NATS JetStream](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/setup-jetstream/).
- The `UnsubscribeConfiguration` call for gRPC API has been deprecated. [6769](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/pull/6769)

- The `certchain`, `issuer-ca-filename`, `issuer-certificate-filename`, and `issuer-key-filename` CLI flags have been deprecated in placement & operator and will no longer have any effect. Placement & operator now only requests their identity certificate from sentry.

- The `token-audience` CLI flag has been deprecated in sentry. Sentry now requires inbound Kubernetes Service Account tokens to have an audience of `dapr.io/sentry` or the SPIFFE ID of sentry (`spiffe://<trust domain>/ns/<namespace>/dapr-sentry`).

- The `DAPR_CERT_CHAIN` and `DAPR_CERT_KEY` daprd environment variables have been deprecated and will be ignored. Daprd must request their identity certificate from sentry.
