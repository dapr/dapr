Get Docker


Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

Docker allows you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you
can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in
the same ways you manage your applications. 

By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s
methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can
significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

You can download and install Docker on multiple platforms. Refer to the following
section and choose the best installation path for you.
