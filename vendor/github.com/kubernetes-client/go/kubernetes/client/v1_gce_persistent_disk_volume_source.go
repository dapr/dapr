// Represents a Persistent Disk resource in Google Compute Engine.  A GCE PD must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same GCE project and zone as the kubelet. A GCE PD can only be mounted as read/write once or read-only many times. GCE PDs support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.
type V1GcePersistentDiskVolumeSource struct {

	// Filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount. Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system. Examples: \"ext4\", \"xfs\", \"ntfs\". Implicitly inferred to be \"ext4\" if unspecified. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk
	FsType string `json:"fsType,omitempty"`

	// The partition in the volume that you want to mount. If omitted, the default is to mount by volume name. Examples: For volume /dev/sda1, you specify the partition as \"1\". Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is \"0\" (or you can leave the property empty). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk
	Partition int32 `json:"partition,omitempty"`

	// Unique name of the PD resource in GCE. Used to identify the disk in GCE. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk
	PdName string `json:"pdName"`

	// ReadOnly here will force the ReadOnly setting in VolumeMounts. Defaults to false. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#gcepersistentdisk
	ReadOnly bool `json:"readOnly,omitempty"`
