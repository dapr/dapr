// EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:   {     Addresses: [{\"ip\": \"10.10.1.1\"}, {\"ip\": \"10.10.2.2\"}],     Ports:     [{\"name\": \"a\", \"port\": 8675}, {\"name\": \"b\", \"port\": 309}]   } The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:     a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],     b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]
type V1EndpointSubset struct {

	// IP addresses which offer the related ports that are marked as ready. These endpoints should be considered safe for load balancers and clients to utilize.
	Addresses []V1EndpointAddress `json:"addresses,omitempty"`

	// IP addresses which offer the related ports but are not currently marked as ready because they have not yet finished starting, have recently failed a readiness check, or have recently failed a liveness check.
	NotReadyAddresses []V1EndpointAddress `json:"notReadyAddresses,omitempty"`

	// Port numbers available on the related IP addresses.
	Ports []V1EndpointPort `json:"ports,omitempty"`
