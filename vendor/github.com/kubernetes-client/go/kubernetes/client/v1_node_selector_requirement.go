// A node selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.
type V1NodeSelectorRequirement struct {

	// The label key that the selector applies to.
	Key string `json:"key"`

	// Represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist. Gt, and Lt.
	Operator string `json:"operator"`

	// An array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. If the operator is Gt or Lt, the values array must have a single element, which will be interpreted as an integer. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
	Values []string `json:"values,omitempty"`
